# 是停下来经历思索而不是快餐式阅读

Being Intentional… Now, one of the things that you’ll come to know about us is that we are intentional. I bet you are, too. As a result… I have a suggestion for you on how to proceed with this ebook. My suggestion is to set some time aside to experience this. That’s right. I said, “experience this.” What do I mean? In our fast-paced world, we develop ways to take in information quickly. It’s a defense mechanism that we’ve all developed over time due to the barrage of emails, texts, and messages we receive daily. We have all learned to “scan” in order to save time. This strategy can help us to be more effective and productive at work and help us to weed through all of things that are thrown our way in a given day. However, there is a risk to this strategy, isn’t there? Right. Sometimes we’re tempted to “scan” something that needs to be read. Out of habit, we speed through something that needs to be “experienced.” This could be one of those times. Frankly, you could speed read through this e-book. If you’re a “scanner” like me you could get through this content in 20 minutes or less. But… if you allow yourself to “experience” it… it could take some significant time. Now, the words “significant time” might make you cringe. I assume your life is very full as you juggle multiple roles, duties and tasks. You’ve probably got things to do at work. You’ve got things to do at home. In fact, it may be late at night as you read this, and there’s a part of you that can’t shake the looming thought of the to-do list that is waiting for you. But… what if you did? What if you gave yourself some time to think about these questions? What if you really allowed yourself to experience them? What if you found a designated place to think about these ideas and questions? A favorite room in your house? A favorite coffee shop? A favorite park bench? What if you gave yourself permission to take some intentional time to dig in? What could happen? Could it be time well spent? You bet. Heck, as you already know this is a big decision. Deciding whether or not to do some kind of coach training is an investment of your time and your cash. More importantly, it’s also dedicating yourself to growing a business and breaking through some of the very obstacles that your potential coaching clients will be facing. That’s why we call these first five questions the “Critical Questions.”


# Are you willing to get paid? 

一开始你是很害怕一个小时100 200的价格说出来的， 不过不用怕，这只是开始 - - ！！！ 

So again I’ll say: Base your price on the potential impact you could have on your client and not on what you think you’re worth during that hour of conversation.

# Are You Willing To Work Hard?

It takes intentionality. It takes determination. It takes work.


# Do you have 15 minutes to spare?

JOURNALING QUESTIONS 

What amount of time do you feel you can invest in becoming a coach right now? Do you have 15 minutes a day? 30? 60 or more? What might you consider cutting from your daily or weekly “time budget” to add to the value of your investment? For example, could you cut back on time spent watching TV? Are there other things you’re willing to forgo to maximize your investment right now? What excited you about the concept of the compounding effect of time and learning?



# 5 Question Asking Secrets

As you know, questions are a life coach’s most important and powerful tool. We can ask questions that will open up possibilities for our clients. We can ask questions that help people see their situation from a different perspective and finally get “unstuck.” We can ask questions to instill a sense of autonomy over the steps they will take which helps them OWN their plan and walk it out. Powerful questions play a critical role in how we bring value to our clients and help them finally achieve the breakthroughs and successes they’ve been wanting. 




# 总结评价

一本问题式的教练启蒙书  让我看到教练是怎样教练人的，都他妈一堆的问题？  不太同意的，  问题，客户回答之后，还得有自己的建议。 然后让客户去做，做完了，然后反馈，再做再给建议，然后让他再做，这是我想要给客户的一种反馈。 而不是我一直打字啊，一直语音啊，一直问题他啊什么的， 给到他去做行动的那个时机我觉得是做教练很关键的一个后续动作，再后面的一个后续动作是给到他建议是非常好的一个后续动作，并且能给他启蒙式的问题让他开始脑洞，思考自主动起来是最好的了。  再一个是 问题+ 解释为什么的原理 如何做 这样子就更好了。
