He got an idea: If all we have is the Trumpet of Victory,
then play the Trumpet of Victory.
What happened next?
Te Trumpet of Victory was sounded, and Alexander’s army,
once facing sure defeat, rallied back to win the battle.
It’s important to think about the mental conditioning of
Alexander’s army in their response to the trumpet. Even though
the individual soldiers couldn’t see the entire battlefeld, the
entire army was conditioned to know that the Trumpet of Victory meant they could fnish oﬀ the enemy if each soldier gave
his all for one fnal push.
So, how does this relate to you at work?
Tink of your last hour of the day, your last set in the gym,
or your last class of school for the day. You’re fatigued and
depleted, but knowing that there’s only one more left—one more
phone call, one more meeting, one more assignment, one more
drill—we somehow always fnd the energy to push ourselves
when we can see a fnish line that’s not far away. So you know
you can condition yourself, at least temporarily, to “bring it” and
give your best eﬀort when you want or need to. Te purpose of
conditioning yourself mentally is to bring this energy level as a
normal, everyday way of being.

# Play Your Own Trumpet -准备去打胜战 西装革履走起来
What’s your Trumpet of Victory? What idea, thought, or signal do
you give yourself in order to give your best push and fnish what you
started? Do you have a routine or process for playing your trumpet?
No matter your answer, let’s dive into how to create a signal
and routine:
1. Choose your signal. What signal will tell you it’s time
to give your best? Your cues should be 100 percent under
your control so you can play your trumpet any time it’s
needed. As an athlete, I wore a short-sleeve T-shirt over
my game jersey during warm-ups; taking oﬀ that T-shirt
was my signal that it was Showtime.
2. Develop your routine. Tink of your routine as setting
up the cameras, lighting, and microphones on a stage
before a play or a concert. When the spotlight shines and
the curtain opens, your Trumpet of Victory needs to be
playing. Your routine is the runway for your Trumpet of
Victory. As a basketball player, I had a specifc dynamic
warm-up routine: High knees. Heel kicks. Dynamic
stretch of both movements. Hip swings. Dynamic
hamstring stretch. Calf stretch. Tis got my body ready
to go, and, since it was a routine I didn’t need to think
about consciously, I could focus my mind on my upcoming performance.
3. Do your homework. A singer has sound check; a salesperson practices her presentation; an actor has dress
rehearsal—all so that when performance time arrives,
their minds are in game mode. As a player, I maintained
a strict ten-to-one practice-to-game ratio at minimum:
I would work on my game, practicing alone at least ten
times for every one game I played in (including halfcourt one-on-one and pickup games, not just ofcial
games with my teams).

# ANTs fnd their way into your subconscious mind through your repetitive thoughts. 

# Step #1: Recognize When ANTs Come Around
Te frst step to killing your ANTs and keeping them away forever is becoming aware of your habits of thought. According
to Dr. Bruce Lipton, former professor of medicine at Stanford
University, at least 85 percent of our daily thoughts are both
habitual and unconscious. Tis means we don’t actually control
most of our thoughts, and we are unaware that the thoughts are
even occurring.
And, just like with real ants, you have to catch them where
they live. Notice yourself reacting negatively to a situation, and
question where that energy is coming from. Te answers you get
help you fnd the nest your ANTs live in.

# Step #2: Have ANTs? Don’t Beat Yourself Up Over It!
When you fnd ANTs (and you will, because everyone has at
least a few), be appreciative of the fact that you now have the
skills to identify them. Most people never even know they have
them. At least now you can do something about them.


# Step #3: Exterminate the ANTs
If you notice any negative thoughts, immediately cancel them
out with at least two positive thoughts on the situation at hand.
By reversing that negative conditioning, you are turning your
mind around in the direction you want it to go.
