He got an idea: If all we have is the Trumpet of Victory,
then play the Trumpet of Victory.
What happened next?
Te Trumpet of Victory was sounded, and Alexander’s army,
once facing sure defeat, rallied back to win the battle.
It’s important to think about the mental conditioning of
Alexander’s army in their response to the trumpet. Even though
the individual soldiers couldn’t see the entire battlefeld, the
entire army was conditioned to know that the Trumpet of Victory meant they could fnish oﬀ the enemy if each soldier gave
his all for one fnal push.
So, how does this relate to you at work?
Tink of your last hour of the day, your last set in the gym,
or your last class of school for the day. You’re fatigued and
depleted, but knowing that there’s only one more left—one more
phone call, one more meeting, one more assignment, one more
drill—we somehow always fnd the energy to push ourselves
when we can see a fnish line that’s not far away. So you know
you can condition yourself, at least temporarily, to “bring it” and
give your best eﬀort when you want or need to. Te purpose of
conditioning yourself mentally is to bring this energy level as a
normal, everyday way of being.

# Play Your Own Trumpet -准备去打胜战 西装革履走起来
What’s your Trumpet of Victory? What idea, thought, or signal do
you give yourself in order to give your best push and fnish what you
started? Do you have a routine or process for playing your trumpet?
No matter your answer, let’s dive into how to create a signal
and routine:
1. Choose your signal. What signal will tell you it’s time
to give your best? Your cues should be 100 percent under
your control so you can play your trumpet any time it’s
needed. As an athlete, I wore a short-sleeve T-shirt over
my game jersey during warm-ups; taking oﬀ that T-shirt
was my signal that it was Showtime.
2. Develop your routine. Tink of your routine as setting
up the cameras, lighting, and microphones on a stage
before a play or a concert. When the spotlight shines and
the curtain opens, your Trumpet of Victory needs to be
playing. Your routine is the runway for your Trumpet of
Victory. As a basketball player, I had a specifc dynamic
warm-up routine: High knees. Heel kicks. Dynamic
stretch of both movements. Hip swings. Dynamic
hamstring stretch. Calf stretch. Tis got my body ready
to go, and, since it was a routine I didn’t need to think
about consciously, I could focus my mind on my upcoming performance.
3. Do your homework. A singer has sound check; a salesperson practices her presentation; an actor has dress
rehearsal—all so that when performance time arrives,
their minds are in game mode. As a player, I maintained
a strict ten-to-one practice-to-game ratio at minimum:
I would work on my game, practicing alone at least ten
times for every one game I played in (including halfcourt one-on-one and pickup games, not just ofcial
games with my teams).

# ANTs fnd their way into your subconscious mind through your repetitive thoughts. 

# Step #1: Recognize When ANTs Come Around
Te frst step to killing your ANTs and keeping them away forever is becoming aware of your habits of thought. According
to Dr. Bruce Lipton, former professor of medicine at Stanford
University, at least 85 percent of our daily thoughts are both
habitual and unconscious. Tis means we don’t actually control
most of our thoughts, and we are unaware that the thoughts are
even occurring.
And, just like with real ants, you have to catch them where
they live. Notice yourself reacting negatively to a situation, and
question where that energy is coming from. Te answers you get
help you fnd the nest your ANTs live in.

# Step #2: Have ANTs? Don’t Beat Yourself Up Over It!
When you fnd ANTs (and you will, because everyone has at
least a few), be appreciative of the fact that you now have the
skills to identify them. Most people never even know they have
them. At least now you can do something about them.


# Step #3: Exterminate the ANTs
If you notice any negative thoughts, immediately cancel them
out with at least two positive thoughts on the situation at hand.
By reversing that negative conditioning, you are turning your
mind around in the direction you want it to go.

# THE THIRD DAY AND BEYOND

# DON’T STOP TRYING

Tere’s a story behind how Formula 409, the popular all-purpose
household cleaner, got its name.
According to Formula 409’s website, the name is a tribute to
the tenacity of the two scientists who invented it. Te scientists
were determined to create the greatest grease-cutting, dirtblistering, bacteria-eliminating cleaner on the planet. It wasn’t
until batch number 409 that the scientists were fnally satisfed
with what they had, so the name stuck.
What would you try 400-plus times until you got it right?
What would make a person disciplined enough to do this or
even think this way? Is it upbringing? Environment? Te type of
work you do? Force of circumstance?
It’s none of those.
Te key to discipline is wanting something strongly enough
that you’re willing to follow a process and delay gratifcation to
get it.
Great business leaders inspire their teams by painting a picture of the future, and a vision of success, that everyone can see
and is willing to stick to the disciplines to get to.
In your life, there are some activities and disciplines that you
will always fnd a way to show up for and get done. I love working out; even as an ex-professional now I still make time for
exercises every day. And there are things you know you should
do that you can easily fnd an excuse not to—for example, I’ve
never been keen on household cleaning. Te determining factor
behind both is the same: you are moved to action or inaction.
What do you want strongly enough that you’re willing to be
disciplined to get it? How disciplined are you capable of being?
Are you willing to be disciplined for long enough to produce the
outcomes you want? Are you willing to apply what you’re learning to see it through to results?
If so, build your discipline by abiding by the following
principles.

# Success and winning are all rooted in sticking to the disciplines—doing the same stuﬀ, over and over again.

# BE PREPARED
Tose who see discipline as boring are usually the people
who most need it. To some, the very act of discipline is like living through a cold, never-ending winter. Tere’s nothing new or
exciting to do. It’s the same routines every day, with no fanfare
or reward. Correct me if I’m wrong, but people who see discipline this way usually have very little of it. Tey sit out the Tird
Days, longing for the fun of summer. Unfortunately, these people don’t often make it to the summers.

Te hardest part of discipline is the monotony: doing the
same stuﬀ over and over again, often for an extended or (seemingly) never-ending period of time. Te “professional” part of
being a professional athlete is not the number of games played,
it’s the repetitive work you do in between the games that’s is not
captured on camera that counts

Abiding by the Tird Day principle, you may not receive
much tangible feedback to tell you whether you’re doing the
right thing or not. It’s frustrating seeing others who you know
haven’t put in the work that you have but are enjoying the results
you thought you’d be seeing. When this happens, stick to what
you’re doing. You are doing the right thing. You are in the right
place. You have the right plan. You are the right person. Discipline is consistency and persistence of eﬀort. You have the
correct formula; just continue applying it.

# OING THE “RIGHT” THINGS ENTITLES YOU TO NOTHING   变通

Following the script, doing exactly as instructed, and taking
all the proper steps does not entitle you to success. Unlike what
we were taught in school, doing everything “right,” or at least
what you think is right, is not a free pass to victory. Te world,
circumstances, and people are always changing, so be prepared
to adjust to what’s in front of you. Life is ﬂuid, so you must
be ﬂuid, too. Make constant adjustments and know things will
never stay the same.

Often athletes will tell me how they have “done everything right,” but have yet to see the results they had hoped for.
Whether the reward you are seeking is a promotion, more playing time on a team, or recognition from team members, there
are always elements that people tend to look over. Tese include:

# Being in the right place. 

Is what you’re oﬀering or representing needed where you are right now? Te funniest comedian in
America probably wouldn’t try booking a gig at a funeral home
(or hey, maybe that’s a great outside-the-box idea).

# Arriving at the right time. 

Why would your product or service be valuable today? What urgent need does it meet? It could
be too soon or too late. Tere were times I was shopping my
services as a basketball player for my next professional playing
contract when a team would tell me that though they liked my
playing abilities, they had already signed a player who played
the same position as me. Right place, wrong time.

# Having the right skills.
You may be very good, even great, at
what you do—but do your skills ft the needs of those you are
oﬀering them to? Maybe you’re getting in front of the wrong
people with the right stuﬀ. An athlete can be a very good player,
but if he’s not very good relative to his teammates, he won’t be
playing. Maybe he’s on the wrong team
