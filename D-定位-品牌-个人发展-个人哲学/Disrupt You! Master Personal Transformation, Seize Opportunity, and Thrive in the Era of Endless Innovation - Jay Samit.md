# THE ART OF SELF-DISRUPTION
自我爆破 需要走出舒适区

Self-disruption is not a comfortable or easy process. It requires you to get out of your comfort zone. 
As trite as it sounds, think of the painful and time-consuming metamorphosis a caterpillar must endure in order to emerge as a brilliant
butterfly. Self-disruption is akin to undergoing major surgery, but you are the one holding the scalpel.

你需要寻找到自己的每一个爆破的弱点进行突破。 分析每一个内部爆破的连接。
When viewed from this framework, the process of self-transformation becomes approachable: you need only analyze each link in your internal value chain and find the single link that’s holding you back. Then make changes to that link to disrupt yourself.

# DISRUPTING YOUR DESIGN AND PRODUCTION LINKS

Don’t let yourself dwell on problem solving as a series of discrete steps. Train yourself to look outside the given variables and see the big picture. Don’t try to see the steps to solving a problem; first visualize the solution and then work backward to determine what you will have to do or build to get to that solution. By thinking this way, you will discover the shortest path, the minimum steps required, and identify all the missing pieces to solve the puzzle. An entire industry has developed around teaching people and institutions to think holistically like this. London-based Innovation Arts is a consultancy that uses “visual facilitation” to change the way corporate teams communicate, design, and develop new products and ideas, with clients ranging from British Telecom to financial services firm Swiss Re.

# 晨间观想的好处！！！

The second benefit of starting your day with visualization is how good it will make you feel. A negative mind will never find success. I have never heard a positive idea come from a person in a negative state.

# 开悟观想 - TURN YOUR ASPIRATIONS INTO INSPIRATIONS
Before you head off on your commute each morning, find a quiet place and retreat to it. Put away the phone and close out the present world. Fifteen minutes each morning will change the outcome of your entire day. Close your eyes and imagine the world you want. What do you aspire to do? Visualize living that life. Visualize every detail and engage all your senses. Hear the waves crashing outside the beach house you want to own. Smell the salty sea air. The more you focus on being in the world you want to create for yourself, the more powerful the results. As Antti Revonsuo discovered by studying subjects while in the dream state of sleep, your subconscious cannot emotionally distinguish between what is real and what you feel is real. Starting each day with a positive mind-set is the most important step in your journey to discovering opportunity.

你想要什么?每一个细节？ 你想要怎样的每一天？流程是？ 

# ASK YOURSELF, WHERE DO I WANT TO GO ALONG THE WAY? 你想要拖延D事项进行A事项的每日行程吗？

 You’ve thought about what you’re aspiring to; now think about what else you want to find along the way. Do you want a family? Are you willing to delay one part of your life to pursue another aspect with more focus? “The purpose of life is a life of purpose,” author and billiards guru Robert Byrne wrote.4 What matters most to you? How you embody and achieve these core values will determine how you measure your success. Try writing these values down on a piece of paper. Be as detailed as you can. Include your personal and professional goals. Next, list your priorities in terms of relationships and time commitments. How much personal, spiritual, and family time do you require? All work and no play is unsustainable as a life plan. You can truly have it all, just not all at the same time. The more realistic you are about how you are going to prioritize your goals in life, the more in charge of your future you will be. For women, balancing goals against a ticking biological clock makes this step all the more important. Try to be honest and complete—the more detail you put into your plan, the more resources you will have to achieve it.
