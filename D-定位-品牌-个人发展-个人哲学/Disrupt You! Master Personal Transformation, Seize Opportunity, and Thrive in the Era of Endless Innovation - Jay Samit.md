# THE ART OF SELF-DISRUPTION
自我爆破 需要走出舒适区

Self-disruption is not a comfortable or easy process. It requires you to get out of your comfort zone. 
As trite as it sounds, think of the painful and time-consuming metamorphosis a caterpillar must endure in order to emerge as a brilliant
butterfly. Self-disruption is akin to undergoing major surgery, but you are the one holding the scalpel.

你需要寻找到自己的每一个爆破的弱点进行突破。 分析每一个内部爆破的连接。
When viewed from this framework, the process of self-transformation becomes approachable: you need only analyze each link in your internal value chain and find the single link that’s holding you back. Then make changes to that link to disrupt yourself.
