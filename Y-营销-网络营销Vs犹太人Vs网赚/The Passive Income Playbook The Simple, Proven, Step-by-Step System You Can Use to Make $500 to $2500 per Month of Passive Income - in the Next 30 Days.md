The Passive Income Playbook The Simple, Proven, Step-by-Step System You Can Use to Make $500 to $2500 per Month of Passive Income - in the Next 30 Days

# 前言
I share the steps I took. I reveal the mistakes I made. You’ll learn from my failures so that you don’t make the same mistakes I did. I tell you how I overcame the hurdles, setbacks, and fears I faced. I explain how I got out of a slump and grew my passive income business when things slowed down. Because THAT’S what people want to know.

# How to SKYROCKET Your Income and Make Long Term Profits

First of all, businesses are built on repeat customers, so you want to build a following. You either want to start an email list using a service like Aweber or GetResponse (I’ve used them both and recommend them) Or, at the very least, you want to create a free Facebook group and invite your readers to join it. So not only are you making money by selling the book, you’re building an audience of fans that will buy from you in the future. Other books. Courses. Coaching. Anything you offer to them.


It’s beyond the scope of this book to show you how to do all of this, but if you join my email list, I’ll show you exactly how (See what I did there?) Once they follow you, give them more content, videos, articles, and tips. They will know, like, and trust you and will be more likely to buy from you again and again, whether it’s more books, software, courses, or coaching packages. Then keep writing more books and simply repeat the process.
