# Paying the Price for Super Success 为成功付出代价

# Take some risks 成功者对冒风险也有不同的看法
The super successful
understand that risk is
necessary to grow.

I believe that ifyou're not taking risks to grow your business, it begins to wither. I hate someone
to tell me everything is running smoothly. By definition, I know their business is not growing anymore - and
probably dying. They have forgonen that from chaos comes order.

# Never fear failure - Understand it.

The super successful also have a different take on failure. They understand that failure is what
happens when you do something. 

# Listen to your intnition -It's almost always right.
Too often we "Excel" things to death. Suppose you're a guy at a party and you meet an attractive woman. Her smile seems,
well, more than friendly. She touches you a lot, innocently. You know she's hot. You don't need to run back
to your office and "Excel" it. You don't have to think about it. You know. Business is much the same. 

# Forget what others think. you've got more to do than second-guess yourself.you should have all the data you need to make a decision.

Too many worry more about what others will think about their decision than they do the wisdom
of the decision itself. What are the guys I play golf with going to think? What will obnoxious cousin Rudy
say? Or Aunt Martha who has cartons ofAmway products in her garage? Come on, do you think Bill Gates
gives a hoot what others think? You think Trump gives a damn for the opinions of"experts" making a fraction
ofhis money? Of course he doesn't. The fact is, you should have all the data you need to make a decision.
You've done your investigation and due diligence. You've met and sized up the other players. Somewhere
deep inside, your gut tells you this is an opportunity you need to seize.
In contrast, the high performance person such as myself measures the risks, makes the decision,
takes action ... and never thinks, "Well, maybe [ should have done this or that. Maybe [ made a mistake. "
As a high performance person, you have the confidence in your judgment to stand by whatever decision you
make. And you've got more to do than second-guess yourself. You've got other important decisions - so you
move on. Without looking back. I often say. "[ may be wrong - but I'm never in doubt." How else could I
have made those 75,000 business decisions?
