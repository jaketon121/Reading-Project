# Chapter One - Super-Success - Not for the Touchy-Feely  超级成功不是凭感觉做事  这本书是关于赚钱


# Paying the Price for Super Success 为成功付出代价

# Take some risks 成功者对冒风险也有不同的看法
The super successful
understand that risk is
necessary to grow.

I believe that ifyou're not taking risks to grow your business, it begins to wither. I hate someone
to tell me everything is running smoothly. By definition, I know their business is not growing anymore - and
probably dying. They have forgonen that from chaos comes order.

# Never fear failure - Understand it.

The super successful also have a different take on failure. They understand that failure is what
happens when you do something. 

# Listen to your intnition -It's almost always right.
Too often we "Excel" things to death. Suppose you're a guy at a party and you meet an attractive woman. Her smile seems,
well, more than friendly. She touches you a lot, innocently. You know she's hot. You don't need to run back
to your office and "Excel" it. You don't have to think about it. You know. Business is much the same. 

# Forget what others think. you've got more to do than second-guess yourself.you should have all the data you need to make a decision.

Too many worry more about what others will think about their decision than they do the wisdom
of the decision itself. What are the guys I play golf with going to think? What will obnoxious cousin Rudy
say? Or Aunt Martha who has cartons ofAmway products in her garage? Come on, do you think Bill Gates
gives a hoot what others think? You think Trump gives a damn for the opinions of"experts" making a fraction
ofhis money? Of course he doesn't. The fact is, you should have all the data you need to make a decision.
You've done your investigation and due diligence. You've met and sized up the other players. Somewhere
deep inside, your gut tells you this is an opportunity you need to seize.
In contrast, the high performance person such as myself measures the risks, makes the decision,
takes action ... and never thinks, "Well, maybe [ should have done this or that. Maybe [ made a mistake. "
As a high performance person, you have the confidence in your judgment to stand by whatever decision you
make. And you've got more to do than second-guess yourself. You've got other important decisions - so you
move on. Without looking back. I often say. "[ may be wrong - but I'm never in doubt." How else could I
have made those 75,000 business decisions?


# Never look back.

One more pre-requisite for super success. The high performance person never looks back. Do you know someone who suffers from terminal buyers' remorse? That individual shops for a new car, new
home, new dress or new anything and then makes a purchase. The next day, he or she begins to revisit all the
reasons the item they didn~ purchase was a better buy. Soon they're miserable. If they can, they return the
item for a refund, and start the same tortuous shopping process over again. They'll never be satisfied because
they don't have confidence in their ability to make a decision. Make every decision as if it's your drop-dead
final word on the matter. Down the line, you may have to do a mid-cotmie correction based on the dynamics
of business. But that's not looking back - that's keeping your eyes forward toward where you're headed.
Big difference.

# Make the sacrifice of Pay Price to ActioD....Take risks... Don't fear failure•.. Listen to your intuition ... Avoid conventional wisdom... Ignore what others think... and never look back.

# Chapter Three - Conventional Wisdom - the Loser's Crutch


# Building Your Personal Foundation 个人基础-打破传统智慧

Before you can create and run a super successful company, you have to re-create yourself. You
have to cleanse your mind of years of conventional wisdom, and in the void that's left, build a personal

Morons are everywhere. They work with you, they conunute with you, go to your health club, live
next door, and are even in your family. They've limited their thinking and would feel much more comfortable
if you'd limit yours too.
You probably even pay for conventional wisdom. Some professions exist to keep you in the box
of "how it's done," and typically attract very careful and conservative men and women with buttoned~down
minds.
