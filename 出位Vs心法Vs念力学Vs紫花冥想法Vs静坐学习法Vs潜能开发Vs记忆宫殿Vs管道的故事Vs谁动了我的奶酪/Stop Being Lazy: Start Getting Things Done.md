# How To Set Reasonable, But Motivating Goals To Get You Excited To Start NOW

Identifying and implementing goals

Identifying what your goals are constitutes the easy part. What most people find tough, however, is carrying out these goals. Thankfully, there are a couple of strategies that you can try out yourself to make it much easier. Begin by creating a set of reasonable and realistic goals. The main reason it is hard for people to follow through with their goals is because their goals are just too far-fetched. It is fine to dream big, but these dreams must be backed by sufficient pragmatism and logic. For instance, if you are a fresh graduate with an entry-level position at a major bank, it would be a little odd to have a goal of becoming the CEO after a year. In other words, creating these sorts of goals only sets you up for disappointment and frustration. To make your goals more manageable, start small. Instead of looking at yearly goals, create daily goals first. Each day, come up with a list of goals that you want to achieve. Later on, move on to weekly goals. Once you get used to weekly goals, that's the time that you can set up monthly goals, and eventually, yearly goals.

20/80 rule

But even small daily goals can seem a little daunting, too. As a result, we sometimes tend to get overwhelmed, to the point that we stop doing anything. So to counter this, try adhering to the 20/80 rule. Basically, the 20/80 rule states that if you are feeling lazy, doing the first 20 percent of the task will help get the ball rolling. This will serve as a good way to kick start your task. The remaining 80 percent will seem a lot easier once you get the momentum derived from accomplishing the initial 20 percent. And most importantly, keep aiming for higher goals. Complacency breeds laziness and procrastination, so do not let up in setting up better goals. This constant need to upgrade goals is a great way to foster improvement and growth.

[Routine - list]  

行程清单 ，怎么样？

先写清单，再跟着清单放入行程表中。  或者自己连行程表都懒得放，直接拿起清单来看，  最简单的一种方式，就是写完清单，放在身边，或者手机写一份清单，挂着手机里头有空看一看就好。
