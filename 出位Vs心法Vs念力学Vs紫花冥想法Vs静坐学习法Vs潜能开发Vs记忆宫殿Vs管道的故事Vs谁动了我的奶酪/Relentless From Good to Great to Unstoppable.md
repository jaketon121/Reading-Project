 # 《Relentless From Good to Great to Unstoppable》

# Don't Think 
# 1. WHEN YOU’RE A CLEANER . . .

In case of emergency, break glass. By the time I
get that call, I know plenty of others have tried and
failed to get control, and they’re out of answers
and options. If you’re a Cleaner, you know what I
mean: everyone else wanted to handle the situation
themselves, and when they finally realized they
couldn’t, they all came looking for you. And in
most cases, you knew it was coming, you just
watched and waited. Now everyone is watching
you to see how you’re going to manage a situation
that seems unmanageable. And you’d better be able
to figure it out fast.

# When what you’re doing isn’t working, find someone who can make itwork. And then let him do it. That’s the Cleaner’s job.

That’s the trademark of a dangerous competitor:
he doesn’t have to know what’s coming because
whatever you show him, he’s ready. No fear of
failure.
That’s not about the myth of “positive thinking”;
it’s about the hard work and preparation that go
into knowing everything there is to know, letting go
of your fears and insecurities, and trusting your
ability to handle any situation.
I’m not saying you can’t think about what you
have to do, but do your thinking and planning in
advance, building your reflexes, so you know when
your back is against the wall, you’ve got the rightmove. You don’t accomplish that by obsessing and
worrying until you’re an emotional mess, unable to
sleep or focus on anything else. You prepare
yourself by knowing you’re ready with the next
bullet to fire. You don’t ever have to pull the
trigger, but you have to know it’s locked and
loaded and available if you need it.
How quickly can you make that adjustment if
you take the wrong step? Can you recognize the
mistake and snap it back? You have to be willing
to fail if you’re going to trust yourself to act from
the gut, and then adapt as you go. That’s the
confidence or swagger that allows you to take risks
and know that whatever happens, you’ll figure it
out. Adapt, and adapt again.

# Figure it out, I learned.

Being relentless means having the courage to
say, “I’m going for this, and if I’m wrong, I’ll make
a change and I’ll still be fine.” You can’t control oranticipate every obstacle that might block your
path. You can only control your response, and your
ability to navigate the unpredictable. Whatever
happens, you have the smarts and skills to figure it
out and arrive at the outcome you wanted in the
first place.
And when I say “figure it out,” I don’t mean
thinking about it for a week and asking everyone
you know what they think. I mean immediately,
instinctively, hearing that voice inside saying,
“This way!” And you go.


# Make mistake ? Fine .

When a Cooler makes a
mistake, he’ll give you a lot of excuses but no
solutions. When a Closer makes a mistake, he finds
someone else to blame. When a Cleaner makes a
mistake, he can look you in the eye and say, “I
fucked up.”
That’s it. Confident, simple, factual, no
explanation. You made a mistake? Fine. Don’t
explain it to me for an hour. The truth is one
sentence, I don’t need a long story. You tell me you
messed up, take responsibility . . . now you’ve
gained my trust. As soon as you start giving me
reasons and rationalizations, I know you have
something to hide, and you’re not ready to take
ownership. Save us both the time. You fucked up.
Say it. There is not a faster way to alleviate
pressure. “Man, I fucked up.” Okay. There’s no
comeback for that, you owned it. Now fix it. You
can’t fix something unless you admit it


Have the confidence to say when you’ve
screwed up, and people will respect you for it.
If you did it, own it. If you said it, stand by it.
Not just the mistakes, but all your decisions and
choices. That’s your reputation. Make it count. If
you want your opinions to have value, you have to
be willing to put them out there and mean what you
say. Two things you can’t let anyone take from you:
you can’t let them take away your reputation, and
you can’t let them take away your balls. That
means accepting the pressure of taking
responsibility for everything you say and do.


# Plan Fast 

The most successful people are those with the
instincts to respond quickly to anything, without
having to go back to the drawing board, watch
more film, schedule a meeting, schedule a meeting
to discuss what will be discussed at the meeting,
or do any of the other countless things people do to
put off making a decision. A couple years ago I
was doing a youth camp for one of the big NBA
sponsors, along with one of my players. They were
expecting five hundred kids. Two thousand showed
up. Everyone went into a panic: not enough
stations, nowhere to put everyone, how did this
happen, who’s to blame . . . Stop. Slow down.
What do we have, what do we need? Give me ten
minutes. I threw out the original plan, devised a
new one. We’ll do it this way. Of course there’s
always someone who can’t adapt, still clinging to
the original failed plan, stammering, “But . . .but . . . we were going to do this and that and . . .”
No. We’re going this way. Conversation over.
Cleaned. That’s what Cleaners do, they ignore the
panicking and complaining, they clean up the
problem and they make it work.
A Closer will adjust himself to the situation; a
Cleaner adjusts the situation to himself. A Closer
has to know what he’s going to do. A Cleaner
doesn’t; he never wants to be locked in to one
plan. He’ll know the original plan, and he’ll
follow it if it feels right to him, but his skills and
intuition are so great that he’ll usually improvise
as he goes; he can’t help it. He just goes with the
flow of the action, and wherever his instincts take
him, that’s what you get.
