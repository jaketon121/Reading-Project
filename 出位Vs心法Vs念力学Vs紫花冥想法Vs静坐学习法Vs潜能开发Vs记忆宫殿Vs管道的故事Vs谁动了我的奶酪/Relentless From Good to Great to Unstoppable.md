# Don't Think 
# 1. WHEN YOU’RE A CLEANER . . .

In case of emergency, break glass. By the time I
get that call, I know plenty of others have tried and
failed to get control, and they’re out of answers
and options. If you’re a Cleaner, you know what I
mean: everyone else wanted to handle the situation
themselves, and when they finally realized they
couldn’t, they all came looking for you. And in
most cases, you knew it was coming, you just
watched and waited. Now everyone is watching
you to see how you’re going to manage a situation
that seems unmanageable. And you’d better be able
to figure it out fast.

# When what you’re doing isn’t working, find someone who can make itwork. And then let him do it. That’s the Cleaner’s job.
