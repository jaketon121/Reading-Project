# Don't Think 
# 1. WHEN YOU’RE A CLEANER . . .

In case of emergency, break glass. By the time I
get that call, I know plenty of others have tried and
failed to get control, and they’re out of answers
and options. If you’re a Cleaner, you know what I
mean: everyone else wanted to handle the situation
themselves, and when they finally realized they
couldn’t, they all came looking for you. And in
most cases, you knew it was coming, you just
watched and waited. Now everyone is watching
you to see how you’re going to manage a situation
that seems unmanageable. And you’d better be able
to figure it out fast.

# When what you’re doing isn’t working, find someone who can make itwork. And then let him do it. That’s the Cleaner’s job.

That’s the trademark of a dangerous competitor:
he doesn’t have to know what’s coming because
whatever you show him, he’s ready. No fear of
failure.
That’s not about the myth of “positive thinking”;
it’s about the hard work and preparation that go
into knowing everything there is to know, letting go
of your fears and insecurities, and trusting your
ability to handle any situation.
I’m not saying you can’t think about what you
have to do, but do your thinking and planning in
advance, building your reflexes, so you know when
your back is against the wall, you’ve got the rightmove. You don’t accomplish that by obsessing and
worrying until you’re an emotional mess, unable to
sleep or focus on anything else. You prepare
yourself by knowing you’re ready with the next
bullet to fire. You don’t ever have to pull the
trigger, but you have to know it’s locked and
loaded and available if you need it.
How quickly can you make that adjustment if
you take the wrong step? Can you recognize the
mistake and snap it back? You have to be willing
to fail if you’re going to trust yourself to act from
the gut, and then adapt as you go. That’s the
confidence or swagger that allows you to take risks
and know that whatever happens, you’ll figure it
out. Adapt, and adapt again.
