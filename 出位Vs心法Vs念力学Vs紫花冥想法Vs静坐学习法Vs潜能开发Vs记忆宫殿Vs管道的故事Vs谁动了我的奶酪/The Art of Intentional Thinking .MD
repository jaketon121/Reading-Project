# The Art of Intentional Thinking: Master Your Mindset. Control Your Thoughts. Transform Your Mental Patterns to Live On Your Own Terms. 

# Chapter 1. Mind Over Matter

# Takeaways: 
What is your mindset? It’s how you see the world, yourself, and your place in the world. 
It’s the overall lens you view everything through. It includes your self-talk, 
your internal voice, and the narrative or story you tell yourself about yourself. 
It’s not technically hard to change because there is no physical activity involved, but it’s hard because effort doesn’t always correlate to results. Simply thinking different can be one of the toughest tasks in the world. Mindset has the power to shape your reality, as proven by the concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy. Famous instances of this include Oedipus and Clever Hans, a horse who appeared to be able to do arithmetic and read. This, along with the placebo effect, wherein a belief or expectation makes that belief or expectation exist, are stunning illustrations of how powerful your mind can be. It’s not just positive thinking; it’s thinking strategically about what you want and what you don’t want. In a sense, your mindset should enable you to put mind over matter or simply overpower your circumstances through your beliefs alone. It may sound fake or too new-age, but it’s a documented part of highly successful people.

# Chapter 5. The Mindset of Action 行动大于思考

“Look before you leap” is a great maxim to follow in certain situations. Literal leaping, for one. Knife-juggling and prescription medication as well. But when seeking to change your mindset and instill new principles to help you get to your goal, I’m strongly for the opposite—leap before you look. This is the mindset that places more importance on doing rather than analyzing or even thinking. It sounds like a risky proposition, but it’s probably safe to say that you have a bit too much safety in your life. Let’s say you’re working on a music platform. You have this fantastic idea for an app—it’s sort of like Shazam on steroids. Not only will it identify what song you’re listening to, but it will also provide you a full list of musician and production credits, along with lyrics and other information that might be relevant. You start mapping it out and telling a couple of trusted associates about it. You’re just about to start on the coding when you start questioning yourself. How are you going to obtain all this information in the first place? You’re sure that if information companies saw your product in action, then they’d be happy to reach a deal to lease out that information, so why don’t you just get started… Wait a minute. Is this something modern music users really want? Who’s going to stop while they’re listening to a certain song because they have to know who exactly who programmed the drum machine? Sure, if a potential customer saw all the information they could get from the app, then they’d see how much they’d enjoy using it. So get to work and… Hold on. How are you going to convince the marketing department to make this a priority? They’re too busy promoting exclusive content. They’re probably going to scoff when you ask them to promote the service—it’s just a list of names and instruments. Seriously? Maybe they could market it to power-users, so why don’t you just go to work on the prototype and… Uh, where’s the budget coming from? Is this something you’re going to work on in your free time? What if it doesn’t work and… Next thing you know, six months have passed you by, and someone else has launched an app doing exactly what yours does. It doesn’t look as good as you think it should, but it was first. Project over. There’s a difference between smart planning and over-caution. If we paused in our tracks to consider every potential warning or predicament, we’d spend so much time in review that we’d effectively stop what we’re doing. Most people never get out of this cycle of inactivity because they find it much easier to be apprehensive than proactive. In actuality, it makes everything that much harder. The mindset of doing and leaping before you look is an underrated aspect of getting to where you want to go. When we think excessively about the possible consequences of doing something, some may be legitimate, but 99% of them are simply excuses to prevent you from taking action. The way to break through this trap is by thinking less and doing more. Always be moving forward—the alternative is staying still or stagnating, and nobody accomplishes anything in that mode. When you’re at that juncture of moving forward or taking pause, it’s always a good idea to err on the side of action and avoid the risk of stasis. Let’s dive into some mindsets that will keep the wheels rolling and you on track to your goals instead of sidelined by yet another shiny object.

# 整体感觉   

这本书整体感觉没有什么内容。 就是故事故事多。  理论理论。  很像涡轮故事。

但又不吸引我。 

我希望有聊而不是有故事。


只讲了一个大概的框架，可以看看goodreder的评论 

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40524076-the-art-of-intentional-thinking

Nothing new here - it's just an overview of various mindset frameworks - but it's well written and helped me identify some things I need to work on. Recommended. 

也就是说我还需要他妈的再搜集一些资讯 书籍 视频 影音 进行对mindset的大致内化 干！  最后行动内化出来，干！
