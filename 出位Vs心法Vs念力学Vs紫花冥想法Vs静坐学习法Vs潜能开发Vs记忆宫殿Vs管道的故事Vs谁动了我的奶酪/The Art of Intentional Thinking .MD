# The Art of Intentional Thinking: Master Your Mindset. Control Your Thoughts. Transform Your Mental Patterns to Live On Your Own Terms. 

# Chapter 1. Mind Over Matter

# Takeaways: 
What is your mindset? It’s how you see the world, yourself, and your place in the world. 
It’s the overall lens you view everything through. It includes your self-talk, 
your internal voice, and the narrative or story you tell yourself about yourself. 
It’s not technically hard to change because there is no physical activity involved, but it’s hard because effort doesn’t always correlate to results. Simply thinking different can be one of the toughest tasks in the world. Mindset has the power to shape your reality, as proven by the concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy. Famous instances of this include Oedipus and Clever Hans, a horse who appeared to be able to do arithmetic and read. This, along with the placebo effect, wherein a belief or expectation makes that belief or expectation exist, are stunning illustrations of how powerful your mind can be. It’s not just positive thinking; it’s thinking strategically about what you want and what you don’t want. In a sense, your mindset should enable you to put mind over matter or simply overpower your circumstances through your beliefs alone. It may sound fake or too new-age, but it’s a documented part of highly successful people.

# 整体感觉   

这本书整体感觉没有什么内容。 就是故事故事多。  理论理论。  很像涡轮故事。

但又不吸引我。 

我希望有聊而不是有故事。


只讲了一个大概的框架，可以看看goodreder的评论

Nothing new here - it's just an overview of various mindset frameworks - but it's well written and helped me identify some things I need to work on. Recommended. 

也就是说我还需要他妈的再搜集一些资讯 书籍 视频 影音 进行对mindset的大致内化 干！
