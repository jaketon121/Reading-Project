7 Deadly Mistakes in Seeking Wealth and Success

# Deadly Mistake #1 - Avoiding Tough Questions

Life is full of tough questions.
Do I really want to be with this person?
How am I going to pay for this?
What would I prefer to do with my life?
And yet we avoid answering those questions because we’re afraid of what the answers
might mean. What if we’ve made the wrong decisions with our lives? What if we need to
make a change? What if someone judges us for our answers?
There’s a reason these questions are tough, and it’s never fun to confront yourself and
make a major decision - or worse, overturn a major decision you’ve ALREADY made.
But when you avoid the touch questions in life, other things can happen.
To start, you stay put. You can’t move forward if you avoid asking questions and
confronting situations that are holding you in place. A bad relationship. An unfulfilling
job. A boring life. If you won’t ask yourself how to fix these things, you’ll never fix them.
At the same time, you are ignoring your instincts.
Some part of you KNOWS these questions are there, waiting to be asked. You can feel
unfulfilled or unhappy inside and yet you wake up every day finding excuses to ignore
those voices.
How many times have you told yourself you were overreacting to a situation, being too
dramatic or just having “a bad day”.
You can only lie to yourself for so long. Continue to do it and you’re going to stay in that
rut the rest of your life.

# The Solution
When you feel surges of strong negative emotions, are upset by small issues, or simply
cannot be somewhere any longer, those are signs that you need a change. Like right
now.
If you ignore those signs, you are missing out on an important opportunity to reach for
success in new and important ways.
You’re shackling yourself and avoiding the potential solution that has been staring you
in the face since you started to feel that way.Take some time and separate yourself from the things that cause you the greatest
stress. Take a weekend trip. Go to the beach. Call off work for the day. Sit at home and
read. Take a bath.
Find a moment or two alone and spend those moments thinking not only about WHY
you feel the way you do, but what you can do about it.
Now start asking those tough questions.
You’re not going to be happy right away. In fact, you’re probably going to be more than
a little upset with yourself.
But the simple act of asking these questions will set you want a path towards better
understanding what you want to get out of life.
That alone can bring you happiness, both in the moment and in the future.


# Deadly Mistake #2 - Living the Life You’ve Been Told to Live

We grow up being told how life should be. What we should strive for, how we should
approach things, and what is realistic to expect.
Parents. Teachers. Bosses. They all have opinions and over the course of nearly 20
years in school, you end up on a trajectory you might not have expected and may not
necessarily enjoy.
But most people, even when they don’t enjoy the trajectory there on, continue.
Why?
For some it is a matter of comfort. This is what you been working towards your entire
life. For others, it’s fear. If everyone you trust and respect is pushing you in a certain
direction, shouldn’t they know best?
It’s hard to know exactly how you should change if something doesn’t feel right.
However, sometimes change is the best thing for you.
The biggest mistake you can make here is staying on a trajectory that just doesn’t feel
right.
Living the life you’ve been told to live since you were a young child, following
instructions from people that don’t have your specific experience, or ignoring something
you’ve long wanted to do because it doesn’t fit the artificial life plan that you’ve created.
These are disasters waiting to happen.
This is how you wake up in 20 or 30 years unsure how you got where you are and
wishing you could take all that time back.
To be sure, there are exceptions. Sometimes you just need to make money to feed your
family.
But when the alternative is clear, and simply feels out of the ordinary or off the beaten
path, you can make a major mistake by staying with what you’ve been doing for too
long.

# The Solution

When you feel stuck, as though you have no options in life and is if you spent your
entire life working toward something that you may not necessarily want, what do you do
next?You make a change.

Exactly what that change is and how it will affect your life depends on a number of
factors.

But the moment you commit to making a change, accept the fact that life is going to be
different from how you know it, and stop listening to people who don’t understand what
you want to get out of your life, you’re going to feel amazing!

This can be a difficult time. Changing everything you feel and believe about the world
around you can be disorienting.

You might feel lost. You might feel confused. You might feel as though everything that
came before was for nothing.

The truth is the exact opposite, however. Everything that came before prepared you to
make this decision and take action to change your life for the better.
The key is to be willing to make that change, to step outside of your comfort zone and
rediscover your dreams and desires.

Success and happiness are not waiting for you at the end of a cubicle lined brick road.
You have to reach out and grab them, and if you let yourself be pushed down a career
path you didn’t choose, you may never be able to do so.

So keep this in mind today as you go to work, come home, see your family, and decide
how to take the next step towards happiness and success.

The path you’ve been waiting for is right in front of you, waiting for you to step foot on it
and take action once and for all.

# Deadly Mistake #3 - Hating Your Job

This is a tricky one.
A lot of people dislike what they do for a living. Many have a good reason for doing so.
Maybe they haven’t asked those tough questions yet. Maybe they’re stuck because of
medical bills or obligations to family.
Maybe they just don’t know how to step off the path and look for new solutions.
The bottom line is that, for whatever reason they feel lost, they do in fact feel lost, and
there’s not much they can do about it without taking action.
Instead of taking action, many people simply start to hate their job. They wake up every
day dreading the drive to work, dreading the time spent with their coworkers, and hating
everything they do.
The negativity this generates can be a major obstacle when it comes time to feel
motivated about anything.
You spend literally 10 to 12 hours every single day bathing in negativity. And while
some of those negative thoughts are perfectly natural, others are manufactured as you
dwell on just how much you dislike what you are doing.
You have significantly greater control over how you think and feel then you realize.
At any time, you can make a major change in your perspective, evaluating and
overhauling the way you interact with the world.
But if you hate your job, stop listening to the people around you, and determine well in
advance that every day is going to be a horrible day, it will be exceptionally hard to
overcome those negative thoughts and empower yourself to take action that will move
you to the career and life path that you’re looking for.

# The Solution

It’s not easy to stop hating your job. After all there’s a very good reason why you feel
that way.
Whether it’s the way you’re treated at work, the lack of fulfillment you feel on the job,
low pay, long hours, or a particular person or persons that treat you poorly, your feelings
are perfectly justified.
That’s why the solution starts within.Peace, success, and happiness are all born within. How you feel and how you perceive
the world will ultimately reflect in how you interact with it.
As they say, those who see the proverbial glass is half-full are more willing to look
positively at everything around them.
Find people at work with whom you can relate. Work with them to think positively and
enjoy the experience of going to work. Learn new things and grow your knowledge so
that you can prepare for your next step in this long journey of life. Develop new skills,
create new relationships, and prepare for your next job.
No matter how bad a situation is, there’s always an opportunity to learn, grow, and
develop new experiences that will help you in the future.
You might hate your job today, but by taking advantage of the resources it offers,
developing relationships with the people you work with, and working towards a goal,
whether internally or at a different location, you can overcome those negative feelings
and use the experience for your betterment.
It’s not easy.
It’s going to take some time, and you’re going to need help from the people you love
and care about.
Discuss with your spouse and friends the support that you’re looking for, and how you’re
trying to change your perspective. It might take time, but with the right focus and right
attention to positive thoughts you can make it happen.
