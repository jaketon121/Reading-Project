7 Deadly Mistakes in Seeking Wealth and Success

# Deadly Mistake #1 - Avoiding Tough Questions

Life is full of tough questions.
Do I really want to be with this person?
How am I going to pay for this?
What would I prefer to do with my life?
And yet we avoid answering those questions because we’re afraid of what the answers
might mean. What if we’ve made the wrong decisions with our lives? What if we need to
make a change? What if someone judges us for our answers?
There’s a reason these questions are tough, and it’s never fun to confront yourself and
make a major decision - or worse, overturn a major decision you’ve ALREADY made.
But when you avoid the touch questions in life, other things can happen.
To start, you stay put. You can’t move forward if you avoid asking questions and
confronting situations that are holding you in place. A bad relationship. An unfulfilling
job. A boring life. If you won’t ask yourself how to fix these things, you’ll never fix them.
At the same time, you are ignoring your instincts.
Some part of you KNOWS these questions are there, waiting to be asked. You can feel
unfulfilled or unhappy inside and yet you wake up every day finding excuses to ignore
those voices.
How many times have you told yourself you were overreacting to a situation, being too
dramatic or just having “a bad day”.
You can only lie to yourself for so long. Continue to do it and you’re going to stay in that
rut the rest of your life.

# The Solution
When you feel surges of strong negative emotions, are upset by small issues, or simply
cannot be somewhere any longer, those are signs that you need a change. Like right
now.
If you ignore those signs, you are missing out on an important opportunity to reach for
success in new and important ways.
You’re shackling yourself and avoiding the potential solution that has been staring you
in the face since you started to feel that way.Take some time and separate yourself from the things that cause you the greatest
stress. Take a weekend trip. Go to the beach. Call off work for the day. Sit at home and
read. Take a bath.
Find a moment or two alone and spend those moments thinking not only about WHY
you feel the way you do, but what you can do about it.
Now start asking those tough questions.
You’re not going to be happy right away. In fact, you’re probably going to be more than
a little upset with yourself.
But the simple act of asking these questions will set you want a path towards better
understanding what you want to get out of life.
That alone can bring you happiness, both in the moment and in the future.


# Deadly Mistake #2 - Living the Life You’ve Been Told to Live

We grow up being told how life should be. What we should strive for, how we should
approach things, and what is realistic to expect.
Parents. Teachers. Bosses. They all have opinions and over the course of nearly 20
years in school, you end up on a trajectory you might not have expected and may not
necessarily enjoy.
But most people, even when they don’t enjoy the trajectory there on, continue.
Why?
For some it is a matter of comfort. This is what you been working towards your entire
life. For others, it’s fear. If everyone you trust and respect is pushing you in a certain
direction, shouldn’t they know best?
It’s hard to know exactly how you should change if something doesn’t feel right.
However, sometimes change is the best thing for you.
The biggest mistake you can make here is staying on a trajectory that just doesn’t feel
right.
Living the life you’ve been told to live since you were a young child, following
instructions from people that don’t have your specific experience, or ignoring something
you’ve long wanted to do because it doesn’t fit the artificial life plan that you’ve created.
These are disasters waiting to happen.
This is how you wake up in 20 or 30 years unsure how you got where you are and
wishing you could take all that time back.
To be sure, there are exceptions. Sometimes you just need to make money to feed your
family.
But when the alternative is clear, and simply feels out of the ordinary or off the beaten
path, you can make a major mistake by staying with what you’ve been doing for too
long.

# The Solution

When you feel stuck, as though you have no options in life and is if you spent your
entire life working toward something that you may not necessarily want, what do you do
next?You make a change.

Exactly what that change is and how it will affect your life depends on a number of
factors.

But the moment you commit to making a change, accept the fact that life is going to be
different from how you know it, and stop listening to people who don’t understand what
you want to get out of your life, you’re going to feel amazing!

This can be a difficult time. Changing everything you feel and believe about the world
around you can be disorienting.

You might feel lost. You might feel confused. You might feel as though everything that
came before was for nothing.

The truth is the exact opposite, however. Everything that came before prepared you to
make this decision and take action to change your life for the better.
The key is to be willing to make that change, to step outside of your comfort zone and
rediscover your dreams and desires.

Success and happiness are not waiting for you at the end of a cubicle lined brick road.
You have to reach out and grab them, and if you let yourself be pushed down a career
path you didn’t choose, you may never be able to do so.

So keep this in mind today as you go to work, come home, see your family, and decide
how to take the next step towards happiness and success.

The path you’ve been waiting for is right in front of you, waiting for you to step foot on it
and take action once and for all.

# Deadly Mistake #3 - Hating Your Job

This is a tricky one.
A lot of people dislike what they do for a living. Many have a good reason for doing so.
Maybe they haven’t asked those tough questions yet. Maybe they’re stuck because of
medical bills or obligations to family.
Maybe they just don’t know how to step off the path and look for new solutions.
The bottom line is that, for whatever reason they feel lost, they do in fact feel lost, and
there’s not much they can do about it without taking action.
Instead of taking action, many people simply start to hate their job. They wake up every
day dreading the drive to work, dreading the time spent with their coworkers, and hating
everything they do.
The negativity this generates can be a major obstacle when it comes time to feel
motivated about anything.
You spend literally 10 to 12 hours every single day bathing in negativity. And while
some of those negative thoughts are perfectly natural, others are manufactured as you
dwell on just how much you dislike what you are doing.
You have significantly greater control over how you think and feel then you realize.
At any time, you can make a major change in your perspective, evaluating and
overhauling the way you interact with the world.
But if you hate your job, stop listening to the people around you, and determine well in
advance that every day is going to be a horrible day, it will be exceptionally hard to
overcome those negative thoughts and empower yourself to take action that will move
you to the career and life path that you’re looking for.

# The Solution

It’s not easy to stop hating your job. After all there’s a very good reason why you feel
that way.
Whether it’s the way you’re treated at work, the lack of fulfillment you feel on the job,
low pay, long hours, or a particular person or persons that treat you poorly, your feelings
are perfectly justified.
That’s why the solution starts within.Peace, success, and happiness are all born within. How you feel and how you perceive
the world will ultimately reflect in how you interact with it.
As they say, those who see the proverbial glass is half-full are more willing to look
positively at everything around them.
Find people at work with whom you can relate. Work with them to think positively and
enjoy the experience of going to work. Learn new things and grow your knowledge so
that you can prepare for your next step in this long journey of life. Develop new skills,
create new relationships, and prepare for your next job.
No matter how bad a situation is, there’s always an opportunity to learn, grow, and
develop new experiences that will help you in the future.
You might hate your job today, but by taking advantage of the resources it offers,
developing relationships with the people you work with, and working towards a goal,
whether internally or at a different location, you can overcome those negative feelings
and use the experience for your betterment.
It’s not easy.
It’s going to take some time, and you’re going to need help from the people you love
and care about.
Discuss with your spouse and friends the support that you’re looking for, and how you’re
trying to change your perspective. It might take time, but with the right focus and right
attention to positive thoughts you can make it happen.


# Deadly Mistake #4 - Falling Into a Rut and Staying There

This goes right along with number three. If you hate your job, why are you still there?
You have children, bills to pay, and other things that keep you from making major life
changes. That’s a good enough reason.
If you don’t have these things, fear of the unknown and lack of information are what
keep you from taking action.
In either case, nine times out of 10 people fail to take action because they’re stuck in a
rut and they’re comfortable there.
How can you be comfortable if you’re miserable? It has to do with the basic needs we
have.
Human beings are hardwired for only a handful of things. Our brains seek out and
gather only the most essential tools and resources needed to live. So you’re going to
gather what you need to pay your bills and feed your family. Combined with the human
fear of loss (it’s a lot scarier to lose something than it is joyful to gain something) and
you can grow “comfortable” in just about any position.
Sometimes are you stuck.
Sometimes you simply don’t have a choice.
But a lot of the time, we tell ourselves we are “stuck” to avoid having to make a decision
or take an action. That’s a scary place to be.
The best way to achieve anything in life is to step outside of your comfort zone and try
something NEW.
Whether that means applying for a job that you wouldn’t normally think you can get,
going to a networking event and focusing on the CEO of a major client, or learning a
new skill or language that will improve your desirability when applying for your NEXT
job, you can gain valuable life experience and step outside of your comfort zone all at
the same time.
Those who remain locked into a single location, never taking action, and always
stumbling from one spot to the next, never quite sure what to do with themselves, this is
a problem.
# The Solution
At a certain point, you need to take action.That’s the message here - take action. That doesn’t mean you have to get results right
away. Don’t hold yourself to an unrealistic standard that will only leave you feeling
dejected and let down three months from now.
But don’t sit there and do nothing either.
Don’t come home and complain about how horrible your job is every night and then
spend four hours watching TV. Take action to make things better.
Learn a new language. Get certified with a certain type of software. Start a website.
Heck, start your own business.
Because at the end of the day, the truth of the matter is this - your future and your
happiness are in your own hands.
If you don’t take action to make them a reality, you’re giving control over your life to
someone else.
Your boss. Your spouse. Your friends.
You’re saying I’m not comfortable making these decisions - make them for me, and it
probably means you’ll stay in the same disappointing job, making the same amount of
money and never learning anything new, for years to come.
If that’s as frustrating to read as it is to type, I know you’re ready to do something about
it.
Now is the time to take action - to get off the couch and go out there - to find someone
or something that will help you climb out of that stupor brought on by years of following
someone’s else’s path and to take action.
If you are ready for that moment, then you are ready to never make this mistake again
and that alone will make you happier and help you find greater success than you would
ever expect.

# Deadly Mistake #5 - Deferring Happiness

Here’s how most people think life will go.
Go to college
Get a boring job
Work for 40 years
Retire and enjoy the fruits of 40 years worth of work
Really? You have to wait 40 years to even start to enjoy all the years you put in? Why?
I’m not saying that you can retire tomorrow or that you’ll be happy right away. But
there’s no reason to settle and accept your “fate” of misery for 40+ years, just for the
potential promise of 20 or so years in retirement, if that.
It depresses me to even think of it that way, and it should depress you too because
millions of people make this mistake every year, and put themselves into a hole so deep
they’ll never be able to come out of it and make smarter, more focused decisions for
their life.
It goes beyond mere work. How many times have you been miserable for days, weeks
or even months when working toward a goal. Focusing so much on the end result that
you never took more than five seconds to think about how you would get there?
We all do it at some point, and it’s a sure way to never truly be happy.
There can be happiness in every minute of every day, but not if you force yourself to
wait on it - to sit back and let it come to you over the course of months rather than
finding reasons to be happy every single day.
The journey is a reward in its own right and deferring happiness or living only for those
small moments of triumph when they occur will keep you constantly seeking something
just out of reach.
# The Solution
There is no clear solution for this problem. However, you can start thinking about the
here and now instead of the future.
One of the most life changing movements in business the last decade or so has been
the elimination of the “deferred happiness” plan.
The “work for 40 years and retire” mentality that most of us are raised to have and that
keeps so many people locked into the same job in the same location and with the same
problems for year after year, most of our lives.How many people do you know that are working somewhere they HATE because
retirement is only 5 years away? 10 years away? Heck, maybe it’s still 20 years away,
but they’re halfway in, so why not keep working, right?
It’s an awful place to be, but if you keep putting off your OWN happiness and letting
work and life suck you dry of any energy and keep you from attempting the things you
want to achieve in life, you’re going to be there too and it’s not as far away as you might
think.
The solution is to live for the here and now.
To be excited for new opportunities and to try new things that you would never have
considered before. The solution is be someone who isn’t content to sit back and let life
pass them by, but that will continue finding new ways to push forward, even when life
gets hard.
You are going to have hard days. There will be times when you don’t want to get up and
go to work. When the only thing you want to do is give up.
If you live for the moment, enjoy the experiences as they come, and don’t expect
yourself to hold off for 40 or more years, these moments will become much easier to
deal with.
It shortens the distance between here and tomorrow.
And when the distances are shorter, they become much more manageable and much
more enjoyable.
Today I want you to take a moment, think about when the last time you let yourself be
excited about something was. When was the last time you didn’t make yourself wait for
something to happen? When was the last time you took action because you wanted to
make something happen, and wanted to be happy.
Let’s make today that day.

# Deadly Mistake #6 - Fearing Failure

“The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make
one.”
- Elbert Hubbard
It’s human nature to fear failure. Ten thousand years ago, failure meant getting eaten by
a mountain lion or not feeding your family, and that my friends is terrifying.
Today failure is not always so dire. A missed bill payment, a bad review at work, or a
blown job interview can certainly hurt and you’re going to be upset - it’s only natural -
but they are only single events in the grand scheme of things.
A single moment of failure rarely means someone in your family goes hungry or you
lose your home.
What failure means is that you tried and maybe things didn’t go as planned, but you at
least tried, and in all likelihood, you learned from your actions. That alone is more than
most people in your situation would do and it helps set you apart in a society filled with
people who are happy to sit back and wait for life to pass them by.
But why do we fear failure so much?
Part of it is the feeling of social judgment that we worry about. No one wants others to
look at them and see their failure. They don’t want to be judged for their decisions, nor
do they want someone to think less of them because they were unable to achieve
something.
We focus so heavily on the bad things that happen when we fail that we often miss all
the good things that come with it.
Yes, failure is a good thing.
When we fail, we learn. We learn so much, in fact, that many of the most successful
entrepreneurs and business owners in the world will cite their failures more often than
their successes when discussing how they got where they got.
These moments don’t happen by accident. Somebody willing to take chances and try
new things is bound to fail. Nobody succeeds 100% of the time.
And because people are willing to take action and try new things, they are capable of
putting themselves in positions to succeed. Not only do you learn from every failure you
make, but because you are taking action, it’s much more likely that you will succeed in
another situation.Who is likely to get a job faster? Somebody who applies to one job and fails in the
interview or somebody who applies to 30 jobs and fails in 29 interviews? Regardless of
the number of rejections they receive, the second person will always be hired first
because they’re willing to learn from their mistakes and try again.

 # The Solution
There is no cure for fear. You will always be afraid that things won’t work out as you
expect them to.
There will be moments when you don’t know what to do and can’t imagine yourself
finding success, even if you try that much harder.
It’s normal. And sometimes no matter how hard you try, and how much you know on an
intellectual level that you should try again, you can’t get yourself to do it.
This is normal too.
Those who are successful, however, and those who find happiness no matter what life
throws their way, or those who are willing to take action and risks without fear of failure.
The fear will always be there, but when the action is taken, these individuals set it aside
and look forward. They think of what they’re going to learn, what they could potentially
achieve, and what the next step will bring them.
So the solution is simple.
Step outside of your comfort zone, take action, no matter how terrifying it might feel, and
be prepared for what comes next.
I can’t promise you that you will succeed, but I can promise that you will learn
something. Whether it’s about your future career, your personal strengths, or yourself in
general, you’re going to learn how to perform better next time, failure or not.
