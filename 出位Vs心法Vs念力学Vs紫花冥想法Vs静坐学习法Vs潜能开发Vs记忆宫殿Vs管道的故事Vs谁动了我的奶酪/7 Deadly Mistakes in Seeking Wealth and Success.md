7 Deadly Mistakes in Seeking Wealth and Success

# Deadly Mistake #1 - Avoiding Tough Questions

Life is full of tough questions.
Do I really want to be with this person?
How am I going to pay for this?
What would I prefer to do with my life?
And yet we avoid answering those questions because we’re afraid of what the answers
might mean. What if we’ve made the wrong decisions with our lives? What if we need to
make a change? What if someone judges us for our answers?
There’s a reason these questions are tough, and it’s never fun to confront yourself and
make a major decision - or worse, overturn a major decision you’ve ALREADY made.
But when you avoid the touch questions in life, other things can happen.
To start, you stay put. You can’t move forward if you avoid asking questions and
confronting situations that are holding you in place. A bad relationship. An unfulfilling
job. A boring life. If you won’t ask yourself how to fix these things, you’ll never fix them.
At the same time, you are ignoring your instincts.
Some part of you KNOWS these questions are there, waiting to be asked. You can feel
unfulfilled or unhappy inside and yet you wake up every day finding excuses to ignore
those voices.
How many times have you told yourself you were overreacting to a situation, being too
dramatic or just having “a bad day”.
You can only lie to yourself for so long. Continue to do it and you’re going to stay in that
rut the rest of your life.

# The Solution
When you feel surges of strong negative emotions, are upset by small issues, or simply
cannot be somewhere any longer, those are signs that you need a change. Like right
now.
If you ignore those signs, you are missing out on an important opportunity to reach for
success in new and important ways.
You’re shackling yourself and avoiding the potential solution that has been staring you
in the face since you started to feel that way.Take some time and separate yourself from the things that cause you the greatest
stress. Take a weekend trip. Go to the beach. Call off work for the day. Sit at home and
read. Take a bath.
Find a moment or two alone and spend those moments thinking not only about WHY
you feel the way you do, but what you can do about it.
Now start asking those tough questions.
You’re not going to be happy right away. In fact, you’re probably going to be more than
a little upset with yourself.
But the simple act of asking these questions will set you want a path towards better
understanding what you want to get out of life.
That alone can bring you happiness, both in the moment and in the future.


# Deadly Mistake #2 - Living the Life You’ve Been Told to Live

We grow up being told how life should be. What we should strive for, how we should
approach things, and what is realistic to expect.
Parents. Teachers. Bosses. They all have opinions and over the course of nearly 20
years in school, you end up on a trajectory you might not have expected and may not
necessarily enjoy.
But most people, even when they don’t enjoy the trajectory there on, continue.
Why?
For some it is a matter of comfort. This is what you been working towards your entire
life. For others, it’s fear. If everyone you trust and respect is pushing you in a certain
direction, shouldn’t they know best?
It’s hard to know exactly how you should change if something doesn’t feel right.
However, sometimes change is the best thing for you.
The biggest mistake you can make here is staying on a trajectory that just doesn’t feel
right.
Living the life you’ve been told to live since you were a young child, following
instructions from people that don’t have your specific experience, or ignoring something
you’ve long wanted to do because it doesn’t fit the artificial life plan that you’ve created.
These are disasters waiting to happen.
This is how you wake up in 20 or 30 years unsure how you got where you are and
wishing you could take all that time back.
To be sure, there are exceptions. Sometimes you just need to make money to feed your
family.
But when the alternative is clear, and simply feels out of the ordinary or off the beaten
path, you can make a major mistake by staying with what you’ve been doing for too
long.

# The Solution

When you feel stuck, as though you have no options in life and is if you spent your
entire life working toward something that you may not necessarily want, what do you do
next?You make a change.

Exactly what that change is and how it will affect your life depends on a number of
factors.

But the moment you commit to making a change, accept the fact that life is going to be
different from how you know it, and stop listening to people who don’t understand what
you want to get out of your life, you’re going to feel amazing!

This can be a difficult time. Changing everything you feel and believe about the world
around you can be disorienting.

You might feel lost. You might feel confused. You might feel as though everything that
came before was for nothing.

The truth is the exact opposite, however. Everything that came before prepared you to
make this decision and take action to change your life for the better.
The key is to be willing to make that change, to step outside of your comfort zone and
rediscover your dreams and desires.

Success and happiness are not waiting for you at the end of a cubicle lined brick road.
You have to reach out and grab them, and if you let yourself be pushed down a career
path you didn’t choose, you may never be able to do so.

So keep this in mind today as you go to work, come home, see your family, and decide
how to take the next step towards happiness and success.

The path you’ve been waiting for is right in front of you, waiting for you to step foot on it
and take action once and for all.
