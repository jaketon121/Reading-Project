7 Deadly Mistakes in Seeking Wealth and Success

# Deadly Mistake #1 - Avoiding Tough Questions

Life is full of tough questions.
Do I really want to be with this person?
How am I going to pay for this?
What would I prefer to do with my life?
And yet we avoid answering those questions because we’re afraid of what the answers
might mean. What if we’ve made the wrong decisions with our lives? What if we need to
make a change? What if someone judges us for our answers?
There’s a reason these questions are tough, and it’s never fun to confront yourself and
make a major decision - or worse, overturn a major decision you’ve ALREADY made.
But when you avoid the touch questions in life, other things can happen.
To start, you stay put. You can’t move forward if you avoid asking questions and
confronting situations that are holding you in place. A bad relationship. An unfulfilling
job. A boring life. If you won’t ask yourself how to fix these things, you’ll never fix them.
At the same time, you are ignoring your instincts.
Some part of you KNOWS these questions are there, waiting to be asked. You can feel
unfulfilled or unhappy inside and yet you wake up every day finding excuses to ignore
those voices.
How many times have you told yourself you were overreacting to a situation, being too
dramatic or just having “a bad day”.
You can only lie to yourself for so long. Continue to do it and you’re going to stay in that
rut the rest of your life.
The Solution
When you feel surges of strong negative emotions, are upset by small issues, or simply
cannot be somewhere any longer, those are signs that you need a change. Like right
now.
If you ignore those signs, you are missing out on an important opportunity to reach for
success in new and important ways.
You’re shackling yourself and avoiding the potential solution that has been staring you
in the face since you started to feel that way.Take some time and separate yourself from the things that cause you the greatest
stress. Take a weekend trip. Go to the beach. Call off work for the day. Sit at home and
read. Take a bath.
Find a moment or two alone and spend those moments thinking not only about WHY
you feel the way you do, but what you can do about it.
Now start asking those tough questions.
You’re not going to be happy right away. In fact, you’re probably going to be more than
a little upset with yourself.
But the simple act of asking these questions will set you want a path towards better
understanding what you want to get out of life.
That alone can bring you happiness, both in the moment and in the future.
