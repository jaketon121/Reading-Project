# How to Be a Couple and Still Be Free

* Discuss changing or conflicting individual moods and feelings, or different needs for intimacy, and find ways to accommodate them.

* Develop a model for partnership, no matter what your style,
orientation, or preference, that works for you and your mate.


# Fear of Difference
There is another reason we often have difficulty resolving problems
and conflicts with our intimate partners, where we handle them clumsily, or even poorly. In a relationship intimate enough that we feel a deep
bonding or sense of commingled identity, we experience a strong tendency to view disagreements as threatening. Disagreeing seems to indicate that we are separate individuals who perceive everything differently
and who have different needs and wants, and we fear that we’ll be rejected or disapproved of if we are different.



# Cooperative Problem Solving 一起解决问题

Cooperation simply means working together as equals, focused on
solving the problem in a way that satisfies both partners’ needs. Cooperative Problem Solving means you solve problems by working together as
equals rather than struggling with each other, so all of your emotional,mental, and creative energy can be focused on creatively exploring the
problem, developing alternatives, putting your mutually chosen solutions into action, and solving the problem.
You may think that’s a lot to promise because the idea that the two
of you can work together to get all that you want every time runs counter
to conventional wisdom and perhaps to your own personal experience.

If you cooperate to solve problems when they arise, the experience of
working together and caring about each other’s wants (Joe and Carol
mutually decide that Carol will drop Joe off, so they both have transportation) builds trust and goodwill between you. This feeling of
trust (the next negotiation about the car will be easier, and Carol and
Joe will be more relaxed because they cooperated this time) and confidence that you can successfully meet challenges together creates a
solid bond between you, and is the key to establishing a Free Couple
Relationship.

Cooperative Problem Solving will help you solve problems:
* When you know what you want, but you’re not getting it.
* When you and your partner seriously disagree over what
you want or how to handle a problem.
* Each time you have a partnership decision to make, from
buying a new car or house to deciding whose career move is
most beneficial.
* If you know you’re unhappy, but aren’t sure what you want.
* If your partner is obviously unhappy and you don’t know
why.
