# Have the right mind-set. 

You must think that relationships are
important. You must believe that you are someone with whom
other people would want to have a relationship. Why would they
want to? Because you have experience, training, skills, abilities,
knowledge (or all five) they value. You must also think well of
others and learn to think as much as you can from the other personâ€™s point of view.
