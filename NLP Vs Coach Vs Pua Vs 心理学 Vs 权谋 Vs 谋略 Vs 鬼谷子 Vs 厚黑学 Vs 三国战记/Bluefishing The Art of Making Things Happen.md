# WHAT MAKES THE LIGHTS TURN ON?
Passion is something that you have to discover. Relax. It takes time. 
That’s normal. Very few people start out knowing at age fifteen or twenty-eight, or even age fifty-five, what their passion is. 
Finding deep and lasting passion for something is a treasure hunt. It takes time to go on that journey and have those experiences. 
But once you do, there’s real fortune at the end once you discover it. And it’s never too late.

# THE WORLD IS ENDING
If you only have twenty minutes left in the day and you can do anything, what do you want to do? 
What would you do if the world were ending?
If you knew that the Earth was going to collide with Mars tomorrow, what would you do right now?

# QUESTION EVERYTHING
Do not believe what people tell you. I’m not saying that they are liars, but most don’t have the ability to communicate effectively.
All of their best information is unsaid, somewhere between the lines. 
It’s like the guy I sent to Napa. You’ve got to be a bit of a psychologist.
You’ve got to challenge them to give you the real answers.
