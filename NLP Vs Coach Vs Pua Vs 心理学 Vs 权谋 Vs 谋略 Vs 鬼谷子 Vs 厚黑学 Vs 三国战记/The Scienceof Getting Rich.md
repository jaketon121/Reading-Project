# Increasing Life

Increasing Life
YOU must get rid of the last vestige of the old idea that
there is a Deity whose will it is that you should be poor, or
whose purposes may be served by keeping you in poverty.
The Intelligent Substance which is All, and in All, and
which lives in All and lives in you, is a consciously Living
Substance. Being a consciously living substance, It must
have the nature and inherent desire of every living
intelligence for increase of life. Every living thing must
continually seek for the enlargement of its life, because life,
in the mere act of living, must increase itself.
A seed, dropped into the ground, springs into activity,
and in the act of living produces a hundred more seeds;
life, by living, multiplies itself. It is forever Becoming More;
it must do so, if it continues to be at all.
Intelligence is under this same necessity for
continuous increase. Every thought we think makes it
necessary for us to think another thought; consciousness is
continually expanding. Every fact we learn leads us to the
learning of another fact; knowledge is continually
increasing. Every talent we cultivate brings to the mind the
desire to cultivate another talent; we are subject to the urge
of life, seeking expression, which ever drives us on to know
more, to do more, and to be more.
In order to know more, do more, and be more we must
have more; we must have things to use, for we learn, and
do, and become, only by using things. We must get rich, so
that we can live more.
The desire for riches is simply the capacity for larger
life seeking fulfillment; every desire is the effort of an
unexpressed possibility to come into action. It is power
seeking to manifest which causes desire. That which makes
you want more money is the same as that which makes the
plant grow; it is Life, seeking fuller expression.

The One Living Substance must be subject to this
inherent law of all life; it is permeated with the desire to live
more; that is why it is under the necessity of creating things.
The One Substance desires to live more in you; hence
it wants you to have all the things you can use.
It is the desire of God that you should get rich. He
wants you to get rich because he can express himself better
through you if you have plenty of things to use in giving
him expression. He can live more in you if you have
unlimited command of the means of life.
The universe desires you to have everything you want
to have.
Nature is friendly to your plans.
Everything is naturally for you.
Make up your mind that this is true.
It is essential, however that your purpose should
harmonize with the purpose that is in All.
You must want real life, not mere pleasure of sensual
gratification. Life is the performance of function; and the
individual really lives only when he performs every
function, physical, mental, and spiritual, of which he is
capable, without excess in any.
You do not want to get rich in order to live swinishly,
for the gratification of animal desires; that is not life. But
the performance of every physical function is a part of life,
and no one lives completely who denies the impulses of the
body a normal and healthful expression.
You do not want to get rich solely to enjoy mental
pleasures, to get knowledge, to gratify ambition, to
outshine others, to be famous. All these are a legitimate
part of life, but the man who lives for the pleasures of the
intellect alone will only have a partial life, and he will never
be satisfied with his lot.
You do not want to get rich solely for the good of
others, to lose yourself for the salvation of mankind, to
experience the joys of philanthropy and sacrifice. The joys
of the soul are only a part of life; and they are no better or
nobler than any other part.
You want to get rich in order that you may eat, drink,
and be merry when it is time to do these things; in order
that you may surround yourself with beautiful things, see
distant lands, feed your mind, and develop your intellect;
in order that you may love men and do kind things, and be
able to play a good part in helping the world to find truth.
But remember that extreme altruism is no better and
no nobler than extreme selfishness; both are mistakes.
Get rid of the idea that God wants you to sacrifice
yourself for others, and that you can secure his favor by
doing so; God requires nothing of the kind.
What he wants is that you should make the most of
yourself, for yourself, and for others; and you can help
others more by making the most of yourself than in any
other way.
You can make the most of yourself only by getting
rich; so it is right and praiseworthy that you should give
your first and best thought to the work of acquiring wealth.
Remember, however, that the desire of Substance is
for all, and its movements must be for more life to all; it
cannot be made to work for less life to any, because it is
equally in all, seeking riches and life.
Intelligent Substance will make things for you, but it
will not take things away from some one else and give them
to you.
You must get rid of the thought of competition. You
are to create, not to compete for what is already created.
You do not have to take anything away from any one.
You do not have to drive sharp bargains.
You do not have to cheat, or to take advantage. You do
not need to let any man work for you for less than he earns.
You do not have to covet the property of others, or to
look at it with wishful eyes; no man has anything of which
you cannot have the like, and that without taking what he
has away from him.
You are to become a creator, not a competitor; you are
going to get what you want, but in such a way that when
you get it every other man will have more than he has now.
I am aware that there are men who get a vast amount
of money by proceeding in direct opposition to the
statements in the paragraph above, and may add a word of
explanation here. Men of the plutocratic type, who become
very rich, do so sometimes purely by their extraordinary
ability on the plane of competition; and sometimes they
unconsciously relate themselves to Substance in its great
purposes and movements for the general racial upbuilding
through industrial evolution. Rockefeller, Carnegie,
Morgan, et al., have been the unconscious agents of the
Supreme in the necessary work of systematizing and
organizing productive industry; and in the end, their work
will contribute immensely toward increased life for all.
Their day is nearly over; they have organized production,
and will soon be succeeded by the agents of the multitude,
who will organize the machinery of distribution.
The multi-millionaires are like the monster reptiles of
the prehistoric eras; they play a necessary part in the
evolutionary process, but the same Power which produced
them will dispose of them. And it is well to bear in mind
that they have never been really rich; a record of the private
lives of most of this class will show that they have really been
the most abject and wretched of the poor.
Riches secured on the competitive plane are never
satisfactory and permanent; they are yours to-day, and
another's tomorrow. Remember, if you are to become rich
in a scientific and certain way, you must rise entirely out of
the competitive thought. You must never think for a
moment that the supply is limited. Just as soon as you
begin to think that all the money is being "cornered" and
controlled by bankers and others, and that you must exert
yourself to get laws passed to stop this process, and so on;
in that moment you drop into the competitive mind, and
your power to cause creation is gone for the time being;
and what is worse, you will probably arrest the creative
movements you have already instituted.
KNOW that there are countless millions of dollars'
worth of gold in the mountains of the earth, not yet
brought to light; and know that if there were not, more
would be created from Thinking Substance to supply
your needs.
KNOW that the money you need will come, even if it is
necessary for a thousand men to be led to the discovery of
new gold mines to-morrow.
Never look at the visible supply; look always at the
limitless riches in Formless Substance, and KNOW that
they are coming to you as fast as you can receive and use
them. Nobody, by cornering the visible supply, can prevent
you from getting what is yours.
So never allow yourself to think for an instant that all
the best building spots will be taken before you get ready to
build your house, unless you hurry. Never worry about the
trusts and combines, and get anxious for fear they will soon
come to own the whole earth. Never get afraid that you will
lose what you want because some other person "beats you
to it." That cannot possibly happen; you are not seeking
any thing that is possessed by anybody else; you are
causing what you want to be created from formless
Substance, and the supply is without limits. Stick to the
formulated statement:
There is a thinking stuff from which all things are
made, and which, in its original state, permeates,
penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe.
A thought, in this substance, produces the thing that is
imaged by the thought.
Man can form things in his thought, and, by
impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause
the thing he thinks about to be created.
