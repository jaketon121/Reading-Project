# 1 Leaving the Shire
像是前言。
And that is what I will teach you: exactly how to take the things you love and use them as inspiration and education to 
help you level up your own life. The Rebellion is glad to have you, 
and I can’t wait to see what game you create for yourself. It starts with taking imperfect action.

# 2 The Cautionary Tale of the Underpants Gnomes
I’m going to let you in on a secret: spend 10 percent of your time and effort on Phase 1, and 90 percent on trying out the 
new things you are learning. Paint your first terrible picture. Write the first chapter of a book that will never be read. 
Ask somebody out and get shot down. Save money for a trip and book the damn thing. Start a crappy blog. Record a few awful podcasts. 
Pluck a few wrong notes on a guitar. Pronounce words incorrectly in a foreign language. Why? Because you’re actually doing something! Nothing comes of collecting more underpants other than a bigger pile of underpants. Until you learn what to do with them,
you’ll only ever have a pile of underpants and never arrive at the happiness you are seeking. 
This book will guide you from Phase 1 to Phase 3, but I cannot complete Phase 2 for you: You’re gonna have to get up off your ass 
and do that yourself.

Phase1 Collect Underpants 
Phase2  ？？？ 90by yourself doing  If not ???  - Phase1 
Phase3 Profit
