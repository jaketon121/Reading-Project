# 1 Leaving the Shire
像是前言。
And that is what I will teach you: exactly how to take the things you love and use them as inspiration and education to 
help you level up your own life. The Rebellion is glad to have you, 
and I can’t wait to see what game you create for yourself. It starts with taking imperfect action.

# 2 The Cautionary Tale of the Underpants Gnomes
I’m going to let you in on a secret: spend 10 percent of your time and effort on Phase 1, and 90 percent on trying out the 
new things you are learning. Paint your first terrible picture. Write the first chapter of a book that will never be read. 
Ask somebody out and get shot down. Save money for a trip and book the damn thing. Start a crappy blog. Record a few awful podcasts. 
Pluck a few wrong notes on a guitar. Pronounce words incorrectly in a foreign language. Why? Because you’re actually doing something! Nothing comes of collecting more underpants other than a bigger pile of underpants. Until you learn what to do with them,
you’ll only ever have a pile of underpants and never arrive at the happiness you are seeking. 
This book will guide you from Phase 1 to Phase 3, but I cannot complete Phase 2 for you: You’re gonna have to get up off your ass 
and do that yourself.

Phase1 Collect Underpants 
Phase2  ？？？ 90by yourself doing  If not ???  - Phase1 
Phase3 Profit 

# Don't know where to start ? Why Not Just Pick One To Play ?

“But, Steve,” you might be thinking, “I don’t know where to start.” As in any game, there will be times when you see many paths
ahead of you, and you have no clue which one you need to take. I hear you, and I know that it can be overwhelming. However, 
the worst thing you can do is sit down on the ground and complain that you don’t know what to do. More information at this point isn’t going to help, either. That’s just more underpants! Instead, why not just make an educated guess, pick a path, and see how things work out? Think of it like becoming the main character in a Choose Your Own Adventure book—it’s tough to find out what happens if you don’t turn the page.

# Let's go !!! Don't afrid to put down the book ! 

do yourself a favor and don’t collect any more underpants for the time being. As you are reading, don’t be afraid to put it down and get started and come back to it as you find different paths along your journey. As Ellie says in Pixar’s Up, “Adventure is out there!” Let’s go find it.

# 3 Ready Player One - Take risk 

Life is meant to be lived on your own terms. - not listen to other .

These people didn’t live the lives they wanted to live; they felt a call to adventure or a call for a path that challenged and fulfilled them, and yet refused the call because they didn’t want to ruffle any feathers or were scared of what that path might reveal. They instead chose the easy, safe, nonconflicting path; a life that others expected them to live, and they would give anything now for an extra life or to try again and take the more adventurous route. Until we develop time machines, older folks will never have the luxury of trying again, but you can certainly learn from the wisdom of their words. If you want to live a life of adventure, you need to stop thinking of what others want for you, and instead start asking what you want for yourself. Yes, choosing to live a life you want might cause some issues or confusion among those around you. If both your parents are doctors, there could be tremendous pressure for you to attend med school; if your siblings are all mechanics, then you might be expected to join the family business. Both my parents were in sales, and although they never once pushed me in that direction, I pushed myself in that direction because I knew it would make them happy, and I didn’t have a strong desire to focus on anything else. But it turns out we do have a chance to be whatever we want to be, to experience the adventures we’ve always dreamed of experiencing, but we have to be willing to reach for them and bold enough to hold ourselves to that higher expectation.

# 4 RESCUE YOUR ALTER EGO FROM DOUBTS AND DISBELIEFS
Just as every saga has a beginning, you, too, have an origin story. I want you to take a few minutes now to write out where you are currently and where you plan on going. In other words, what does your real life look like, and how would you spend your time as superhero? If you’re not quite sure yet what your super power is or how you’ll be spending your free time as a superhero, don’t worry. That’s what I’m here for. The important thing is to advance your journey by starting. Remember, the more dire your situation is now, the more epic your trip to becoming a Hero will be. The world needs you to become who you were meant to be.


If you’re not sure how to write out your origin story and alter ego, then try this activity: write as if you were looking back on your life at age 99. What did you accomplish in your adventures? What are you known for? Who did you impact? Dream as big and as grand or as small and specific as you’d like to. It’s your story, and you get to write the script! I want to know where you are, and where you plan on going. If you’re still struggling with this, I’ll hold your hand even more—after all, that’s what mentors are for. Here’s a Mad Lib you can fill in to help get you started: [Your name]> lived a humble existence as a nerdy [your day job/occupation]. Like other superhero origin stories, the hero struggled with [character flaw or thing missing in your life]. However, as the prophecies of old foretold, change was coming. Thanks to [call to action], and the amazing tutelage of the ridiculously good-looking, clever, and modest mentor, Steve, our hero transformed, creating [alter ego name] to protect the lives of his/her loved ones. Although our hero lives out an ordinary life by day, at night he/she is an absolute badass, known for [epic skill], [fun adventurous story], and one time even [something you never thought you’d be capable of].


# 5 RESIST TEMPTATIONS AND CONVENIENT EXCUSES  排除借口

# 6 BEWARE DARK FORCES, HIDDEN FOES, AND HATERS 排除敌人

[Matrix] 

we’ve all been programmed to follow a specific set of rules that govern how we exist. For the past 80-plus years, that’s gone something like this: get a job for the most money you can, buy the biggest house you can, the nicest car, the biggest television, and work your ass off for 40-plus years until you retire at 65 to finally enjoy the good life. This is the wool that has been pulled over our eyes to keep us complacent and subdued. We’re taught and told by everybody around us that this is just the way things are, and we’re supposed to follow along and not cause any trouble.


When you decide you no longer want to play by the rules of the Matrix and instead play by your own rules, some will get confused and others might not like it very much. Those still trapped will see you forging your own path and potentially get jealous or tell you to “be realistic.” Just as every story has heroes and villains, allies and enemies, so too will your path to success. So that we’ll be prepared to defeat them when they inevitably materialize.


# You don't to do the same boring everyday tired .

You don’t need to live the life expected of you. You don’t need to be doing something simply because it’s always been done that way. And there’s nothing telling you that you need to follow the traditional path of the trapped Matrix prisoner: wake up, go to a job, eat, come home, watch TV, sleep, repeat. You might be single and 20, or married and 40, or divorced with three kids at 60. Either way, The Rebellion needs you. Regardless of your current situation, we can get started living a better, healthier, happier life today. Remember Rule #1 of The Rebellion: “We don’t care where you came from, only where you’re going.” When you can find that happy medium between enjoying today, making improvements, and planning for tomorrow, amazing things start to happen and life gets epic—the story arcs you live start to build on top of each other; each completion of the circle brings more adventure, more stories, more growth, and more personal transformation. Whether you plan on improving your life through a renewed focus on making an impact at work, finding happiness with activities after work, a physical transformation that enables you to participate in more activities, or a focus on travel by radically adjusting how you make a living—changes to the source code will have you seeing ones and zeroes like Neo and have you playing on a completely different level than everybody else around you.
