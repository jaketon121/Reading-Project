# 1 Leaving the Shire
像是前言。
And that is what I will teach you: exactly how to take the things you love and use them as inspiration and education to 
help you level up your own life. The Rebellion is glad to have you, 
and I can’t wait to see what game you create for yourself. It starts with taking imperfect action.

# 2 The Cautionary Tale of the Underpants Gnomes
I’m going to let you in on a secret: spend 10 percent of your time and effort on Phase 1, and 90 percent on trying out the 
new things you are learning. Paint your first terrible picture. Write the first chapter of a book that will never be read. 
Ask somebody out and get shot down. Save money for a trip and book the damn thing. Start a crappy blog. Record a few awful podcasts. 
Pluck a few wrong notes on a guitar. Pronounce words incorrectly in a foreign language. Why? Because you’re actually doing something! Nothing comes of collecting more underpants other than a bigger pile of underpants. Until you learn what to do with them,
you’ll only ever have a pile of underpants and never arrive at the happiness you are seeking. 
This book will guide you from Phase 1 to Phase 3, but I cannot complete Phase 2 for you: You’re gonna have to get up off your ass 
and do that yourself.

Phase1 Collect Underpants 
Phase2  ？？？ 90by yourself doing  If not ???  - Phase1 
Phase3 Profit 

# Don't know where to start ? Why Not Just Pick One To Play ?

“But, Steve,” you might be thinking, “I don’t know where to start.” As in any game, there will be times when you see many paths
ahead of you, and you have no clue which one you need to take. I hear you, and I know that it can be overwhelming. However, 
the worst thing you can do is sit down on the ground and complain that you don’t know what to do. More information at this point isn’t going to help, either. That’s just more underpants! Instead, why not just make an educated guess, pick a path, and see how things work out? Think of it like becoming the main character in a Choose Your Own Adventure book—it’s tough to find out what happens if you don’t turn the page.

# Let's go !!! Don't afrid to put down the book ! 

do yourself a favor and don’t collect any more underpants for the time being. As you are reading, don’t be afraid to put it down and get started and come back to it as you find different paths along your journey. As Ellie says in Pixar’s Up, “Adventure is out there!” Let’s go find it.

# 3 Ready Player One - Take risk 

Life is meant to be lived on your own terms. - not listen to other .

These people didn’t live the lives they wanted to live; they felt a call to adventure or a call for a path that challenged and fulfilled them, and yet refused the call because they didn’t want to ruffle any feathers or were scared of what that path might reveal. They instead chose the easy, safe, nonconflicting path; a life that others expected them to live, and they would give anything now for an extra life or to try again and take the more adventurous route. Until we develop time machines, older folks will never have the luxury of trying again, but you can certainly learn from the wisdom of their words. If you want to live a life of adventure, you need to stop thinking of what others want for you, and instead start asking what you want for yourself. Yes, choosing to live a life you want might cause some issues or confusion among those around you. If both your parents are doctors, there could be tremendous pressure for you to attend med school; if your siblings are all mechanics, then you might be expected to join the family business. Both my parents were in sales, and although they never once pushed me in that direction, I pushed myself in that direction because I knew it would make them happy, and I didn’t have a strong desire to focus on anything else. But it turns out we do have a chance to be whatever we want to be, to experience the adventures we’ve always dreamed of experiencing, but we have to be willing to reach for them and bold enough to hold ourselves to that higher expectation.
