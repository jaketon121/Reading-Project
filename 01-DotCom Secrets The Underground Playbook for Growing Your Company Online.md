# SECTION ONE:LADDERS AND FUNNELS

# SECRET #1:THE SECRET FORMULA

- Who? Where?

- I asked myself, “WHO is the person I really want to work with?” Up to that point in
my business, I had been trying to sell to anyone and everyone I could. While that sounds
smart at first, it left me tired, frustrated, and empty inside.

- After I got a good idea of WHO I would ideally work with if I had that choice, I
started to think about the RESULT I would want to give them. I asked myself, “Wherecould I serve my customer at the highest level?” I realized it wasn’t through a product or a
service. Rather, it was by giving them a result that would change their lives. That result is
where I wanted to take them.

- Where? Bait?

- Where are these people? How can I find them online? What type of bait can I create
to attract my dream client and repel everyone else?

- These questions eventually became the outline for what I now call “The Secret
Formula,” and it’s really the first step that you HAVE to take before you can grow any
company.

# Question #1: Who Is Your Dream Client? 

- The first question you have to ask
yourself is, Who do I actually want to work with? Most of us start with a product idea,
never thinking about who we want as clients, customers, vendors, and associates. But
these are the people you will be interacting with day in and day out. You’ll probably spend
more time with these people than your own friends and family. You choose your
significant other carefully, so why wouldn’t you take the same time and care in deciding
who your dream client or customer will be? If you’re just getting started, this may not
seem important. But I promise you that if you don’t consciously choose your dream client,
one day you will wake up like I did, working with people who exhaust you and wishing
that someone could fire you from the business you created.

- Who  ?

- Who are my dream clients?
What do they look like?
What are they passionate about?
What are their goals, dreams, and desires?
After about a week of thinking about the WHO question, I sat down and created two
customer avatars: one for the men I wanted to work with and one for the women I wanted
to work with.

# Question #2: Where Can You Find Them? 

- The next question in the Secret Formula
is WHERE can you find this ideal man or woman? Where do they hang out online? Are
they on Facebook or Instagram? What groups are they part of? What email newsletters do
they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? Are they reading The New York Times or The
Huffington Post? What other interests do they have? Do they like sports or the arts? How
about fishing or race cars? If you don’t know the who, it will be hard to find out where
your perfect client can be found.

# Question #3: What Bait Will You Use to Attract Them? 

- Once we know where the
dream customers are, we have to create the right bait to attract them. Your bait could be a
physical book, a CD, DVD, or an audio recording—anything that your dream customer
would pay attention to and want.

- When you find out what your dream clients want, it becomes very easy to attract them. 


# Question #4: What Result Do You Want To Give Them? 

- Once you’ve hooked your
dream customers with the perfect bait, the last question is what RESULT do you want to
give them? I’m not talking about what product or service you want to sell them. A
business is NOT about products and services. A business is about what result you can get
for your clients. Once you (and they) understand that concept, then price is no longer a
barrier.

- I understand that many of my customers won’t be able to pay me for that level of
service (which is why we develop other products and services), but understanding where
you ultimately want to take the dream client is the key to this step.
Imagine that your clients could pay you anything to get a desired result. What, then,
would you do to help guarantee their success? Where would you lead them? What does
that place look like? Keep that place in your mind; it’s the pinnacle of success for your
clients. It’s where you want to take them, and it’s the key to this last step.


# SECRET #2: THE VALUE LADDER

- You may buy one of my home study courses or attend one of my live events. If you
receive value from that, then you may decide to sign up for my $10,000 Ignite program, or
maybe my $25,000 Inner Circle program. And if I provide awesome value there, then you
will naturally want to keep ascending … and THAT is how we sell our million-dollar
packages. We provide insane amounts of value at each step of our Value Ladder, so our
clients naturally want to ascend, get more value, and pay us more money.

- Oh yeah, and just like the dentist, no Value Ladder is complete without a good
continuity program. There are many ways to structure your continuity program. It could be
organized around software, membership sites, or ongoing coaching, but it should be
something you can bill for each month. That residual income will become the lifeblood of
your business. For my DotComSecrets business, our main continuity program is our
software ClickFunnels, which allows people to create sales funnels with the click of a
mouse. Our clients pay us monthly to use this software to help run their businesses. It
saves them a ton of time and money and provides us with residual income. Win-Win.

- The only limit to your value offerings is your imagination. Keep thinking of higher
and higher levels of service, and you can keep charging more and more money. There’s
always something else you can offer.
