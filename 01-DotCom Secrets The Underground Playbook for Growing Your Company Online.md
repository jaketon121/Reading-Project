# SECTION ONE:LADDERS AND FUNNELS

# SECRET #1:THE SECRET FORMULA

- Who? Where?

- I asked myself, “WHO is the person I really want to work with?” Up to that point in
my business, I had been trying to sell to anyone and everyone I could. While that sounds
smart at first, it left me tired, frustrated, and empty inside.

- After I got a good idea of WHO I would ideally work with if I had that choice, I
started to think about the RESULT I would want to give them. I asked myself, “Wherecould I serve my customer at the highest level?” I realized it wasn’t through a product or a
service. Rather, it was by giving them a result that would change their lives. That result is
where I wanted to take them.

- Where? Bait?

- Where are these people? How can I find them online? What type of bait can I create
to attract my dream client and repel everyone else?

- These questions eventually became the outline for what I now call “The Secret
Formula,” and it’s really the first step that you HAVE to take before you can grow any
company.

# Question #1: Who Is Your Dream Client? 

- The first question you have to ask
yourself is, Who do I actually want to work with? Most of us start with a product idea,
never thinking about who we want as clients, customers, vendors, and associates. But
these are the people you will be interacting with day in and day out. You’ll probably spend
more time with these people than your own friends and family. You choose your
significant other carefully, so why wouldn’t you take the same time and care in deciding
who your dream client or customer will be? If you’re just getting started, this may not
seem important. But I promise you that if you don’t consciously choose your dream client,
one day you will wake up like I did, working with people who exhaust you and wishing
that someone could fire you from the business you created.

- Who  ?

- Who are my dream clients?
What do they look like?
What are they passionate about?
What are their goals, dreams, and desires?
After about a week of thinking about the WHO question, I sat down and created two
customer avatars: one for the men I wanted to work with and one for the women I wanted
to work with.

# Question #2: Where Can You Find Them? 

- The next question in the Secret Formula
is WHERE can you find this ideal man or woman? Where do they hang out online? Are
they on Facebook or Instagram? What groups are they part of? What email newsletters do
they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? Are they reading The New York Times or The
Huffington Post? What other interests do they have? Do they like sports or the arts? How
about fishing or race cars? If you don’t know the who, it will be hard to find out where
your perfect client can be found.
