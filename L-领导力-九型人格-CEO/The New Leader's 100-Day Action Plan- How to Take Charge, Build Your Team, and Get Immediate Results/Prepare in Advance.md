# Prepare in Advance

The context of your promotion will affect the early leadership challenges you face. The smoothest and easiest transitions follow planned
promotions. When succession planning works and the right leader is
in the right spot at the right time, most feel in control and few feel
threatened. When this happens to you, be grateful and make the best
of a good situation.
But it’s not always like that. When there’s a sudden leadership
gap and you get an unexpected call to fill it, regaining control of the
situation and of the rampant runaway emotions can be a significant
challenge. Uncertainty is scary for all.
Work to understand the thinking behind the decision and begin
communicating with and understanding your new stakeholders. Look
carefully at the number and quality of things changing in your own
situation. You’ll need far more help if you’re getting promoted to run
a new function in a new industry in a new country than if you’re taking over from the boss whose deputy you’ve been for the past decade.
An internal promotion suggests that senior management sees value
in continuity, “insider knowledge,” and a “known entity” (you) rather
than the risk, hassle, and ramp-up time of an outsider. There may
be an expectation of change, however, and insiders often lose grip of
their opportunity by being afraid to rock the boat. Get a clear sense
of the expectations and deliver accordingly.
Perhaps the most challenging case is when you have to fill a gap
as the interim leader. It helps a lot to get clarity on whether “ interim ”
means “holding the fort until we find the right person, which absolutely will not be you,” or “on probation with a good chance of
becoming permanent,” or “filling the role on a temporary basis as
a developmental opportunity. ” In either case, it’s likely a good posture
to engage fully with the work while eschewing the perks of the job—
basically focusing your efforts on the least prestigious, highest-impact
tasks and leaving the glory to others.
