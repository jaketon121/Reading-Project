This Is What Success Looks Like 13 Steps Anyone Can Follow - Bryan Zimmerman

# 1 问答游戏 - 牺牲的心态

For the first step, get away from everything that is a distraction. Any noise that can break your concentration, any people that can make you lose focus and just be by yourself. If that happens after everyone goes to bed, fine. If you have to go sit in your car in a parking lot to make it happen, then that's what you have to do. Find a place you can be alone with yourself for this. It’s extremely important. Here is where you put away all of the walls you have built. There are no emotions here. It is as if you are completely alone on an island with nobody to criticize your thoughts, ideas or decisions. All of the “why can't I”, “if I only could”, “I can't handle it” and any other “can't” phrases go away here. It's at this point you want to look inward and you ask yourself – “What is it I really want and what am I willing to do to get it?”

“What is it I really want and what am I willing to do to get it?” 

Were there concerns? If there were, they weren't on my end. I had a house to pay for, I had mouths to feed and I had bills to pay, but I didn't care. I'd collect aluminum cans on the side of the road if I had to, to make ends meet, but the current situation was going to change. I had been dabbling in online marketing for a couple of years and while I was making some money, it wasn't anywhere near what I was making in construction. All I knew was that I wanted more and I had to do what I had to do to get it.

“A goal without a plan is not a goal at all. It's a wish”

if you don't actually map it out, you're going to fail.

The most important thing is that you must also write down HOW your plan to reach them!

It does you no good to set a goal of being financially secure but then having no plan behind it on how you're going to achieve it. You have to strategize it, formulate it and map it out, step by step. You wouldn't get a two-thousand piece puzzle, dump it on the table and just proceed to try and put random pieces together. You'd formulate a plan for it. You would start by putting the edges together, then you would separate things into like colors. It’s likely you would work on one section of those colors at a time, and then blend them together as the picture on the box shows. As you complete each part or your puzzle, you gain a sense of accomplishment. With each accomplishment, you gain confidence in the direction you are taking. Not only can you see it, but you can also feel the progress you're making on what will very soon become a finished puzzle.


------------------------------------
When I first began waiting tables, I wanted one of those “good money, and go home early” stations, and I wanted it quickly.  In order to do this, I had to structure out what it would take to basically force them to put me in one. The first thing I did was watch how everyone else acted, responded and adjusted during a shift. I'll cover this much deeper later in another step, but I had to figure out exactly what it was going to take to give me the best chance to get the station I wanted. Once I had a good idea, I wrote out my plan. 


# Good Money – Go Home Early Plan

1) Be ready for work thirty minutes before time to leave. 

2) Get to work no later than fifteen minutes early.

3) Say “hello” to everyone I see as I enter the building and make sure to USE THEIR NAMES. 

4) Find managers and/or owner and say “hello” before starting the shift.

5) Ask the cooks and dish crew if they need any drinks. 

6) Say “hello” to bus boys and ask them how they're doing.

7) Help the hostesses with the drinks, their tables and customers. 

8) Run food no less than ten times for other people. 9) Grab plates under manager’s window and take to dish pit no less than five times. 

10) Pre-bus table down to needing to be wiped only at least six times.

11) Check with bartenders to see if they need anything at least three times. 

12) Check with cooks and dish crew near the end of shift to see if they need drinks. 

13) Ask the managers if there is anything they need me to do before ending the shift and clocking out. 

14) Say “thank you” and “good bye” to all of the back of house staff before leaving, remembering to USE THEIR NAMES. 

15) Say “thank you” to bus boys, bartenders, hostesses and managers before leaving, remembering to USE THEIR NAMES. 

16) Double check that all of my tables and side work is done and complete before leaving.

# 3  观想电影游戏

When we talk about mind power, I mean the ability to actually visualize something that hasn't happened yet. You visualize something you want to happen. Something you're working towards with your tasks, goals and progress.  You're already busting your ass to make it happen, but here's that little bit extra that gives it a push. The key is to not just visualize it in your mind, but to actually make it so real in your mind that's it's happening right at that very moment.

Level One 

Level one is as if you are watching a movie of yourself doing something. You close your eyes and picture a big movie screen, just as if you were in a movie theater. On that movie screen, visualize yourself doing exactly what it is you want to achieve. This could be anything that you want to see yourself accomplish. See yourself speaking on stage, going to the bank to cash a million dollar check, getting promoted, standing on a scale and seeing the number you want to have reached, or any other situation you can think of. Watch and pay close attention to your facial expressions, your body movements and your surroundings on the screen. What you're looking for here is that feeling you get when you're really into a movie that you get emotionally involved. I’m sure you’ve been so into a movie at one time or another where you forget for a minute it's not real. 

You feel good when the guy gets the girl or the hero saves the day. You get nervous when the buildup happens and you get on the edge of your seat. You know it's a movie, but you're emotionally invested in it. That's the feeling you want to get yourself into when you're watching a movie of yourself in your mind.  This is your own private movie, so make it play exactly how you would want it to and make sure to feel yourself becoming emotionally invested in it. 

Level one is very powerful so don't underestimate it just because there are two other methods. This level alone can do wonders for making things change and getting what you want. So please, I'll ask you again, start with this one first and see how well you can do it. When you can get to that emotionally invested state like you do when you're into a good movie, keep doing it for at least seven days in a row before moving on to level two.

Level Two 

In level two, instead of watching yourself in a movie, you're going to watch yourself as if you were in the stands or in the audience, live. Just as in level one, you are controlling what you're seeing yourself do, so make it exactly what you want. In this level though you want to make it so real it is as if you are actually there, live and in person. Concentrate on how you feel watching yourself do what it is you've chosen to see. Watch yourself breathing, your movements, your and facial expressions. Feel your emotions and take in your surroundings. Try and feel it as if you were right there watching yourself in person and exactly how that would feel. Feel how proud of yourself you are, how important it makes you feel to see yourself doing exactly what you want, Notice the way the way others are looking at you and how that makes you feel. Notice the smell in the room, your breathing and pay attention to your own emotions as you watch yourself. The goal here is to make it so real that it's as if it's actually happening. Level two is obviously more powerful than level one because you're actually putting yourself in the situation. It's no longer something you're watching on a movie screen, you're actually IN the movie watching it happen. At this level you can actually feel the atmosphere and sense the smells in the room. It's true emotion. To your body and mind, it's the same as when you were at that professional sports game or in the audience as your favorite band played or something important in your life happened. When you can make this type of visualization happen, keep at it for at least seven days before moving on to level three.


Level Three 

Level three is the most powerful level and one that may take you a little time to master. It's worth every second you put into it though, because you can truly make magical things happen here. In level three, you are no longer watching yourself. You ARE yourself. At this level of visualization, everything happens as if you were watching it through you own eyes, just like you're reading this right now. Through your own eyes, as if it was happening right now, be IN the situation you want to be in. Notice everything you can here. How your feet feel on the ground, how your breathing is, how your clothes feel on your body, how you emotionally feel right at that moment and every other little detail you can recognize. The goal is to make it feel so real that you're body and mind can't tell the difference between the visualization and reality. This is the exact same state of consciousness as those dreams that are so real when you wake up it takes you a second to recognize it was a dream. The reason this is so powerful is because it's feeding your subconscious mind exactly what it needs to have to make whatever it is your seeing actually happen. Think about learning to drive and what that was like in the beginning.  After a while, you don't even think of working the brake and the gas and how it functions. You don't think about turning on your turn signal or stopping at a red light, it just happens. You've driven so many times at this point that many times you can actually go 10 miles and not remember what you saw or how fast they went by.  This is because you've done it over and over and it's all controlled by your subconscious mind now.  You don't even have to think about it, you just do it. Level three is doing the exact same process and it's the same process thousands of professionals have used to achieve what they want. You visualize things in a way that is so real, your body believes it is really happening. The more you do it, the more your body recognizes it has done it and it becomes completely subconscious.  As far as your body and mind are concerned, you've already had that promotion, made that million dollars, created that amazing product or got exactly what you wanted so it's not a huge deal to now subconsciously direct you towards situations to actually make that happen.  The key is getting to a level where there is no difference between the visualization and reality, as far as your mind is concerned. 

You've already experienced the rush of emotion, the adrenaline, the fear, the worry, the joy, the excitement and the outcome over, and over again. So as you're doing the work to make things happen, your body already knows how to react or adapt in your favor because it's already been through it countless times.

The key to this is consistency! Just like anything else, the more you do it the better you get at it. This isn't something you can do with a bunch of distractions going on either. You need to set aside some quiet time so you can focus and concentrate without distractions. From this point, you should practice your visualization EVERY DAY even if it's just for just ten minutes. I like to do it first thing in the morning before anyone is awake, or right before I go to bed. I find that starting off my day with visualization just puts me in the best situation to get the day started right. I've gotten to the point where I can do everything at level three, so when I'm done I'm already on cloud nine. I've already seen and felt what I want to happen, and now that I'm starting my day, subconsciously I'm already working towards it. Ideally you'd like to get 30 minutes a day to practice and visualize, the better you get at it, the less time you will have to spend doing it. I've got myself to the point now I can do it in about ten minutes.  We can all find 30 minutes where we can get some time to visualize, so make it a priority from this point on. It will change your life.

Again, I know you may be reading this saying you don't have 30 minutes. My response to that is you may need to go back and re-read one of the previous steps and make your commitment.  Either that or you're still more into the idea of success than actually doing what you need to really make it happen. If that's you, I understand. But you'll wind up working for people like me instead of getting what you want.


# 比对成功法

Right now, many people who are reading this are pumped up, ready to put up a squeeze page, adjust their engagement and start running traffic, right?  Wrong again. You're still not thinking! While you're watching, this is the time you're adjusting your list you created in an earlier step! You're watching what someone else is doing that has got them to where you want to be. You compare what you're noticing to the things you set out for yourself and seeing where you can make changes and improvements. Then you take that research even further and you look at how they are getting their traffic. Are they running advertisements? Do they have affiliates? Are they doing ad swaps, webinars, thank you page links and a ton of other traffic strategies? I won't go into all of those, but finding out this information helps you to see how they're doing it and what your options are to do it yourself. Are they friends with these affiliates? Do they cross promote each other or are they well networked in. Do you want to know? Then sign up for the lists of the affiliates and see what they're promoting!

他们做了什么？ 他们怎么做？ 什么情况做什么？ 

他们赚钱打广告了吗？ 他们花了多少钱打广告？ 

大部分人都没有时间观察 做分析。

Something you'll hardly hear anyone tell you is to watch what they do that didn’t work out and try to figure out why. What did they do differently or why didn't it work out? How did they react to that? Did they get upset about it? Did they walk away and get depressed or did they go back and figure something else out and come back and try again quickly? What was their response to it? How did they react to it? How did they deal with it? You pick up so much by really watching and looking for the details in situations. Most people don't do this. They are too busy focusing on what their ego is telling to feel to even notice the lessons happening right in front of them. Don't be that person. It'll hold you back from what you really want!


# 4 竞争比对

If you want to get better at anything, you have to have two things. The desire to work hard to achieve it and to surround yourself with people who are better than you at it.  If you talk to any professional athlete, they will tell you the best way to get better is to play against people who are better than you. Yes, they're going to kick your ass for a good while, but you will automatically begin to get better because you're forced to! It's just another way your subconscious mind helps you out. The more you do it, the better you get, and the harder you work.

The other side is, if you surround yourself with players who are not at your level, your game will drop. Sure, you may be the best in the group, but it's not helping you sharpen your game. There's no competition there and you're not going to be anywhere near as focused or driven to grow. You've capped out, so to speak.

In business, it's no different. If all you do is hang around people who make the same amount as you, the chances of you making big jumps in money is slim and none. I'm definitely not saying you should stop being friends with them anymore, which would be a stupid move. I am still better friends with people who make one tenth of what I make than ones that make the same or more as me. However, when it comes to talking about business situations, goals, ideas and any other situation, I'm talking to people who make more. Why? Because they've been there already, and I'm “watching” them as I talked about in the previous chapter!

Look at a person’s watch and see if there's anything special about it. Does it have a sports team on it? Is there a Mickey Mouse on it? Many times, gifts are given from grandparents, children, etc. Is it expensive and they're constantly making sure it's in eye sight of others? All of these things provide clues. Look at their clothes and see if you can notice anything that will give you those clues to who they are. People who play golf usually wear certain brands, as do people who play tennis. Look at their shoes to see if they are wearing runners or dress shoes. Hang around close to their conversations to see if you can pick up anything that you can casually mention in passing, or just as a conversation starter. You're looking for the “human” element that gives you the opportunity to integrate. Some of you may think you will not find anything that gives you that opportunity, but it's there. You just have to keep looking, it's the key to it all.


# 5 牺牲  sacrifices

When I was waiting tables, I wanted the station I wanted. I did everything to make sure it happened, no matter what it was. If I had to stay late, I did. If I had to take extra tables, I did. If I had to clean up someone else’s tables, or work in the dish pit, or do someone else's side work or even come in early, I did it.

It has to be that way. You will have to make sacrifices. In the end, it's worth it. Let yourself never be that person that sits in their wheel chair at eighty years old and says “I wish I would have given more effort to that when I had the opportunity”.


# 6  CHAPTER 10 THE 11TH COMMANDMENT

 This is the shortest chapter in the book because there is no real way to say it other than in plain English. It's also my favorite chapter because it's something I've always prided myself on knowing no one will ever do it better than I do.  Bold statement? 
 
 Absolutely, but I believe it and that's all that matters (more on that later). You have to work. You have to work hard. You have to work harder. And when you think you’ve worked hard enough then you need to work even harder!  Why? Because that’s exactly what that person did that’s in the position you want to be in. 
 
 Nothing is handed to anybody and when you think you’ve worked enough then you need to spend a little bit longer and work some more. 
 
 You have to ask yourself the question, 
 
 “If I get those things that I wrote down that I wanted, when I reach that point and I have those things, will I look back and say all that hard work that I put in was worth it?  The times I wanted to quit, when I wanted to stop, when I wanted to go to bed, when I wanted to watch TV, when I wanted to go to a concert, but I skipped all that stuff. Is where I am now, was it worth sacrificing all those things I gave up to obtain it?” The answer will be “HELL YES!” If I gave you a sheet of paper, a blueprint, that listed everything you had to do in the next three years, everything you needed to do on a daily basis and made the promise that at the end of that three years, if you had done them all, you'd get five million dollars, would you take it? Of course you would, almost everyone would. That's what you're creating here from the material in this book. 
 
 You're making your own blueprint! You just plug in what you want the end result to be and put forth the effort to make it happen. 
 
 The 11th Commandment in my life, and now in yours too, is Thou Shalt Get To Work!


# 不舒服游戏

The only way to deal with a comfort zone in business and in life is to smash the walls down! The best thing you can do for yourself is to do something outside of your comfort zone each day. Every day, look for something that's outside your comfort zone and then DO IT! If you do this every day, imagine what it will take to actually make you uncomfortable! Over the course of time, there's not going to be much that you're not comfortable doing.

# CHAPTER 20 THE FASTEST WAY TO BECOMING A PRODUCTIVE MACHINE

The Mindset Blueprint

the one thing that separates people who are successful is having the ability to block out all the distractions and focus on PRODUCTIVE tasks. They don’t let things distract them, but at the same time they’re don’t spend their entire lives with their nose to the grind stone, either. They know exactly what they need to do and how they need to do it to get there. You’re going to be shown how to do this in this blueprint. By doing these things, you avoid all of the things that basically do nothing more than waste a huge portion of your day, and it will force you to turn the corner in your business.


Part 1 – Your Plan Every successful business starts with a plan. I don't care if it's a beauty salon, radio shop, service repair company, or an online business. Every single one that has been successful began with a plan. This is where a lot of people really screw up. I like to equate it someone trying to go on a diet.


To state the obvious, the reason we have a plan is: 

1) You Have To Know Where You Are Going Before You Start 

2) If You Don't Have A Plan You Are Setting Yourself Up To Fail

The two plans you are going to create are: 

A Personal Plan       

A Business Plan



# 浪费的节约方法 -记录上网具体事项


For the next five days, I want you to write down exactly what you do and what times you are doing it while you are supposed to be working. I don't care if it's answering the phone, getting the mail or going to the bathroom. Write down anything that you do while you are on work time. Write down what you are doing, the time you start doing it and the time you stop doing it. Write down everything you do during your “work” time. This means that if you get up to go to the bathroom at 3:00 p.m. and you get back at 3:05 p.m., write it down. If you start reading emails at 4:00 p.m., write it down. When you are done with your emails, write down the time you stopped. I don't care what you are doing, if you do something during the hours you have set aside to work, write it down for five consecutive days.



So, to recap this portion: 

1) Work in one hour blocks of time. 

2) Take a five minute break after each hour.

3) Work with a timer to keep on plan.

4) Cut of all distractions.
