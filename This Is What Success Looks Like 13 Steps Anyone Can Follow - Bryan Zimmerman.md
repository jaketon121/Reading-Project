This Is What Success Looks Like 13 Steps Anyone Can Follow - Bryan Zimmerman

# 1 问答游戏 - 牺牲的心态

For the first step, get away from everything that is a distraction. Any noise that can break your concentration, any people that can make you lose focus and just be by yourself. If that happens after everyone goes to bed, fine. If you have to go sit in your car in a parking lot to make it happen, then that's what you have to do. Find a place you can be alone with yourself for this. It’s extremely important. Here is where you put away all of the walls you have built. There are no emotions here. It is as if you are completely alone on an island with nobody to criticize your thoughts, ideas or decisions. All of the “why can't I”, “if I only could”, “I can't handle it” and any other “can't” phrases go away here. It's at this point you want to look inward and you ask yourself – “What is it I really want and what am I willing to do to get it?”

“What is it I really want and what am I willing to do to get it?” 

Were there concerns? If there were, they weren't on my end. I had a house to pay for, I had mouths to feed and I had bills to pay, but I didn't care. I'd collect aluminum cans on the side of the road if I had to, to make ends meet, but the current situation was going to change. I had been dabbling in online marketing for a couple of years and while I was making some money, it wasn't anywhere near what I was making in construction. All I knew was that I wanted more and I had to do what I had to do to get it.

“A goal without a plan is not a goal at all. It's a wish”

if you don't actually map it out, you're going to fail.

The most important thing is that you must also write down HOW your plan to reach them!

It does you no good to set a goal of being financially secure but then having no plan behind it on how you're going to achieve it. You have to strategize it, formulate it and map it out, step by step. You wouldn't get a two-thousand piece puzzle, dump it on the table and just proceed to try and put random pieces together. You'd formulate a plan for it. You would start by putting the edges together, then you would separate things into like colors. It’s likely you would work on one section of those colors at a time, and then blend them together as the picture on the box shows. As you complete each part or your puzzle, you gain a sense of accomplishment. With each accomplishment, you gain confidence in the direction you are taking. Not only can you see it, but you can also feel the progress you're making on what will very soon become a finished puzzle.


------------------------------------
When I first began waiting tables, I wanted one of those “good money, and go home early” stations, and I wanted it quickly.  In order to do this, I had to structure out what it would take to basically force them to put me in one. The first thing I did was watch how everyone else acted, responded and adjusted during a shift. I'll cover this much deeper later in another step, but I had to figure out exactly what it was going to take to give me the best chance to get the station I wanted. Once I had a good idea, I wrote out my plan. 


# Good Money – Go Home Early Plan

1) Be ready for work thirty minutes before time to leave. 

2) Get to work no later than fifteen minutes early.

3) Say “hello” to everyone I see as I enter the building and make sure to USE THEIR NAMES. 

4) Find managers and/or owner and say “hello” before starting the shift.

5) Ask the cooks and dish crew if they need any drinks. 

6) Say “hello” to bus boys and ask them how they're doing.

7) Help the hostesses with the drinks, their tables and customers. 

8) Run food no less than ten times for other people. 9) Grab plates under manager’s window and take to dish pit no less than five times. 

10) Pre-bus table down to needing to be wiped only at least six times.

11) Check with bartenders to see if they need anything at least three times. 

12) Check with cooks and dish crew near the end of shift to see if they need drinks. 

13) Ask the managers if there is anything they need me to do before ending the shift and clocking out. 

14) Say “thank you” and “good bye” to all of the back of house staff before leaving, remembering to USE THEIR NAMES. 

15) Say “thank you” to bus boys, bartenders, hostesses and managers before leaving, remembering to USE THEIR NAMES. 

16) Double check that all of my tables and side work is done and complete before leaving.
