This Is What Success Looks Like 13 Steps Anyone Can Follow - Bryan Zimmerman

# 1 问答游戏 - 牺牲的心态

For the first step, get away from everything that is a distraction. Any noise that can break your concentration, any people that can make you lose focus and just be by yourself. If that happens after everyone goes to bed, fine. If you have to go sit in your car in a parking lot to make it happen, then that's what you have to do. Find a place you can be alone with yourself for this. It’s extremely important. Here is where you put away all of the walls you have built. There are no emotions here. It is as if you are completely alone on an island with nobody to criticize your thoughts, ideas or decisions. All of the “why can't I”, “if I only could”, “I can't handle it” and any other “can't” phrases go away here. It's at this point you want to look inward and you ask yourself – “What is it I really want and what am I willing to do to get it?”

“What is it I really want and what am I willing to do to get it?” 

Were there concerns? If there were, they weren't on my end. I had a house to pay for, I had mouths to feed and I had bills to pay, but I didn't care. I'd collect aluminum cans on the side of the road if I had to, to make ends meet, but the current situation was going to change. I had been dabbling in online marketing for a couple of years and while I was making some money, it wasn't anywhere near what I was making in construction. All I knew was that I wanted more and I had to do what I had to do to get it.

“A goal without a plan is not a goal at all. It's a wish”

if you don't actually map it out, you're going to fail.

The most important thing is that you must also write down HOW your plan to reach them!

It does you no good to set a goal of being financially secure but then having no plan behind it on how you're going to achieve it. You have to strategize it, formulate it and map it out, step by step. You wouldn't get a two-thousand piece puzzle, dump it on the table and just proceed to try and put random pieces together. You'd formulate a plan for it. You would start by putting the edges together, then you would separate things into like colors. It’s likely you would work on one section of those colors at a time, and then blend them together as the picture on the box shows. As you complete each part or your puzzle, you gain a sense of accomplishment. With each accomplishment, you gain confidence in the direction you are taking. Not only can you see it, but you can also feel the progress you're making on what will very soon become a finished puzzle.


------------------------------------
When I first began waiting tables, I wanted one of those “good money, and go home early” stations, and I wanted it quickly.  In order to do this, I had to structure out what it would take to basically force them to put me in one. The first thing I did was watch how everyone else acted, responded and adjusted during a shift. I'll cover this much deeper later in another step, but I had to figure out exactly what it was going to take to give me the best chance to get the station I wanted. Once I had a good idea, I wrote out my plan. 


# Good Money – Go Home Early Plan

1) Be ready for work thirty minutes before time to leave. 

2) Get to work no later than fifteen minutes early.

3) Say “hello” to everyone I see as I enter the building and make sure to USE THEIR NAMES. 

4) Find managers and/or owner and say “hello” before starting the shift.

5) Ask the cooks and dish crew if they need any drinks. 

6) Say “hello” to bus boys and ask them how they're doing.

7) Help the hostesses with the drinks, their tables and customers. 

8) Run food no less than ten times for other people. 9) Grab plates under manager’s window and take to dish pit no less than five times. 

10) Pre-bus table down to needing to be wiped only at least six times.

11) Check with bartenders to see if they need anything at least three times. 

12) Check with cooks and dish crew near the end of shift to see if they need drinks. 

13) Ask the managers if there is anything they need me to do before ending the shift and clocking out. 

14) Say “thank you” and “good bye” to all of the back of house staff before leaving, remembering to USE THEIR NAMES. 

15) Say “thank you” to bus boys, bartenders, hostesses and managers before leaving, remembering to USE THEIR NAMES. 

16) Double check that all of my tables and side work is done and complete before leaving.

# 3  观想电影游戏

When we talk about mind power, I mean the ability to actually visualize something that hasn't happened yet. You visualize something you want to happen. Something you're working towards with your tasks, goals and progress.  You're already busting your ass to make it happen, but here's that little bit extra that gives it a push. The key is to not just visualize it in your mind, but to actually make it so real in your mind that's it's happening right at that very moment.

Level One 

Level one is as if you are watching a movie of yourself doing something. You close your eyes and picture a big movie screen, just as if you were in a movie theater. On that movie screen, visualize yourself doing exactly what it is you want to achieve. This could be anything that you want to see yourself accomplish. See yourself speaking on stage, going to the bank to cash a million dollar check, getting promoted, standing on a scale and seeing the number you want to have reached, or any other situation you can think of. Watch and pay close attention to your facial expressions, your body movements and your surroundings on the screen. What you're looking for here is that feeling you get when you're really into a movie that you get emotionally involved. I’m sure you’ve been so into a movie at one time or another where you forget for a minute it's not real. 

You feel good when the guy gets the girl or the hero saves the day. You get nervous when the buildup happens and you get on the edge of your seat. You know it's a movie, but you're emotionally invested in it. That's the feeling you want to get yourself into when you're watching a movie of yourself in your mind.  This is your own private movie, so make it play exactly how you would want it to and make sure to feel yourself becoming emotionally invested in it. 

Level one is very powerful so don't underestimate it just because there are two other methods. This level alone can do wonders for making things change and getting what you want. So please, I'll ask you again, start with this one first and see how well you can do it. When you can get to that emotionally invested state like you do when you're into a good movie, keep doing it for at least seven days in a row before moving on to level two.

Level Two 

In level two, instead of watching yourself in a movie, you're going to watch yourself as if you were in the stands or in the audience, live. Just as in level one, you are controlling what you're seeing yourself do, so make it exactly what you want. In this level though you want to make it so real it is as if you are actually there, live and in person. Concentrate on how you feel watching yourself do what it is you've chosen to see. Watch yourself breathing, your movements, your and facial expressions. Feel your emotions and take in your surroundings. Try and feel it as if you were right there watching yourself in person and exactly how that would feel. Feel how proud of yourself you are, how important it makes you feel to see yourself doing exactly what you want, Notice the way the way others are looking at you and how that makes you feel. Notice the smell in the room, your breathing and pay attention to your own emotions as you watch yourself. The goal here is to make it so real that it's as if it's actually happening. Level two is obviously more powerful than level one because you're actually putting yourself in the situation. It's no longer something you're watching on a movie screen, you're actually IN the movie watching it happen. At this level you can actually feel the atmosphere and sense the smells in the room. It's true emotion. To your body and mind, it's the same as when you were at that professional sports game or in the audience as your favorite band played or something important in your life happened. When you can make this type of visualization happen, keep at it for at least seven days before moving on to level three.


Level Three 

Level three is the most powerful level and one that may take you a little time to master. It's worth every second you put into it though, because you can truly make magical things happen here. In level three, you are no longer watching yourself. You ARE yourself. At this level of visualization, everything happens as if you were watching it through you own eyes, just like you're reading this right now. Through your own eyes, as if it was happening right now, be IN the situation you want to be in. Notice everything you can here. How your feet feel on the ground, how your breathing is, how your clothes feel on your body, how you emotionally feel right at that moment and every other little detail you can recognize. The goal is to make it feel so real that you're body and mind can't tell the difference between the visualization and reality. This is the exact same state of consciousness as those dreams that are so real when you wake up it takes you a second to recognize it was a dream. The reason this is so powerful is because it's feeding your subconscious mind exactly what it needs to have to make whatever it is your seeing actually happen. Think about learning to drive and what that was like in the beginning.  After a while, you don't even think of working the brake and the gas and how it functions. You don't think about turning on your turn signal or stopping at a red light, it just happens. You've driven so many times at this point that many times you can actually go 10 miles and not remember what you saw or how fast they went by.  This is because you've done it over and over and it's all controlled by your subconscious mind now.  You don't even have to think about it, you just do it. Level three is doing the exact same process and it's the same process thousands of professionals have used to achieve what they want. You visualize things in a way that is so real, your body believes it is really happening. The more you do it, the more your body recognizes it has done it and it becomes completely subconscious.  As far as your body and mind are concerned, you've already had that promotion, made that million dollars, created that amazing product or got exactly what you wanted so it's not a huge deal to now subconsciously direct you towards situations to actually make that happen.  The key is getting to a level where there is no difference between the visualization and reality, as far as your mind is concerned. 

You've already experienced the rush of emotion, the adrenaline, the fear, the worry, the joy, the excitement and the outcome over, and over again. So as you're doing the work to make things happen, your body already knows how to react or adapt in your favor because it's already been through it countless times.

The key to this is consistency! Just like anything else, the more you do it the better you get at it. This isn't something you can do with a bunch of distractions going on either. You need to set aside some quiet time so you can focus and concentrate without distractions. From this point, you should practice your visualization EVERY DAY even if it's just for just ten minutes. I like to do it first thing in the morning before anyone is awake, or right before I go to bed. I find that starting off my day with visualization just puts me in the best situation to get the day started right. I've gotten to the point where I can do everything at level three, so when I'm done I'm already on cloud nine. I've already seen and felt what I want to happen, and now that I'm starting my day, subconsciously I'm already working towards it. Ideally you'd like to get 30 minutes a day to practice and visualize, the better you get at it, the less time you will have to spend doing it. I've got myself to the point now I can do it in about ten minutes.  We can all find 30 minutes where we can get some time to visualize, so make it a priority from this point on. It will change your life.

Again, I know you may be reading this saying you don't have 30 minutes. My response to that is you may need to go back and re-read one of the previous steps and make your commitment.  Either that or you're still more into the idea of success than actually doing what you need to really make it happen. If that's you, I understand. But you'll wind up working for people like me instead of getting what you want.

Right now, many people who are reading this are pumped up, ready to put up a squeeze page, adjust their engagement and start running traffic, right?  Wrong again. You're still not thinking! While you're watching, this is the time you're adjusting your list you created in an earlier step! You're watching what someone else is doing that has got them to where you want to be. You compare what you're noticing to the things you set out for yourself and seeing where you can make changes and improvements. Then you take that research even further and you look at how they are getting their traffic. Are they running advertisements? Do they have affiliates? Are they doing ad swaps, webinars, thank you page links and a ton of other traffic strategies? I won't go into all of those, but finding out this information helps you to see how they're doing it and what your options are to do it yourself. Are they friends with these affiliates? Do they cross promote each other or are they well networked in. Do you want to know? Then sign up for the lists of the affiliates and see what they're promoting!
