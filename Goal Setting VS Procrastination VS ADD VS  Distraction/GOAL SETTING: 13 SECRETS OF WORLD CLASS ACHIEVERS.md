Big Dreamers - They set and accomplish goals that help not only themselves, but also other people.

[Write it down] - What was John’s secret? First, he wrote his dreams down. I’ll bet that’s something you’ve heard before. I heard it for twenty years and ignored it too! But the fact is, writing your goals down is powerful, increasing your chances of success by at least 1000% according to Brian Tracy.

Exercise 2: In his book The Success Principles, Jack Canfield suggests answering the following questions: Reflect on why you’re here. What is your ultimate purpose in life? What do you want to be, do, and have? What do you want to accomplish? What do you want to experience? What possessions do you wish to acquire? What does success look like to you? Make a list of: 30 things you want to do; 30 things you want to have; and 30 things you want to be before you die. Vague desires and goals produce vague results. Be as clear and detailed as possible. Once you are clear about what you want, keep your mind focused on it. The how will show up. 


Exercise 3: This exercise is in Dr. Daniel Amen’s book Change Your Brain, Change Your Life. This exercise is called the “One Page Miracle,” and will help to guide your thoughts, words, and actions in a positive and goal-oriented way. Take a sheet of paper and write the following headings: Relationship Spouse Children Extended Family Friends Work Money Short-Term Long-Term Myself Body Mind Spirit Next to each subheading, clearly write out what’s important to you in that area of your life. Write down what you want. Be positive, and write in the first person. Keep a copy with you so you can work on it over time. Place it where you can see it every day. By looking at it every day, you will consciously focus on what’s important to you. You will more easily be able to supervise yourself and match your actions to what you want. Your life will become more conscious, and you will spend more of your time and energy focused on what’s important to you.
