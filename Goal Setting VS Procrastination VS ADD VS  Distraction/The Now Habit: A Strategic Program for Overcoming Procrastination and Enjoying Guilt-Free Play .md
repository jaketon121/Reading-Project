The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play 


# THREE-DIMENSIONAL THINKING AND THE REVERSE CALENDAR

Tackling any large project requires an overview of its size, length, and breadth so
that you can plan the direction you will take and decide when and where you will start.
When you survey the task before you, you will commonly experience a surge of energy (stress or anxiety)
as your body tries to be in several places at once along the imagined course of your project. 

It’s as if you have your nose up against a skyscraper with the expectation that you have to get to the
top in one exhausting leap. You’ve created a two-dimensional picture of your project—all work, all at once,
with no time to catch your breath. This picture collapses the steps involved so that your body 
responds with energy to work on all the parts—beginning, middle, and finish—simultaneously.


# The Reverse Calendar

When Joel applied three-dimensional thinking to his assignments, 
he was able to see the entire process, directing his energy toward dividing the project into small, 
manageable parts. This view lets you mentally spread the work out over the days and weeks ahead, 
creating your own deadlines for the subdivisions of the project.

When you learn to look at projects this way, you rapidly diffuse the condensed effort of two-dimensional thinking into
a three-dimensional and four-dimensional view spread over distance and time. Now, instead of facing a large, 
looming, impossible task, you’re facing only small units that you can see yourself accomplishing.

# 1. Ultimate deadline
June 1. Have drawings or speech or project on boss’s desk by 9:00 A.M. 
That means May 28: Make corrections.
May 26: Review materials. May 23: Secretary’s deadline for mailing out reproductions/making slides/collecting data. 
May 15: Complete sketches/rewrites/follow-up calls. 
May 1: Start on final portion of project. 
April 22: Make changes from meeting with boss. 
April 21: Meet with boss on direction and progress. 
Today, April 15: Make rough sketches; start outline; 
decide on most relevant market research and consult with experts.

# 2. Ultimate deadline
January 1 (next year). Complete negotiations for the contract with XYZ, Inc. 
That means December 1: Meeting with lawyers and XYZ manager.
November 20: Call XYZ before leaving for ski trip, Nov. 22-27. 
November 1: Deliver last segment of draft contract to Jones. 
(Continue to schedule each month until you come back into the present) 
July 1: Meet with our lawyers. 
Today, June 15: Contact Jones at XYZ to discuss deadlines and meeting times. 
This approach can be applied to each step of the project. Putting together a large company report,
for example, can contain steps which in themselves may be overwhelming. 
But when the work is divided into its various parts and tackled piecemeal, the first section can be started today. 
Creating a reverse calendar for the project will give you a time line for each step, 
letting you know how much time you must allocate in each week—for example, twenty hours a week for five weeks.
