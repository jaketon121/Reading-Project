Welcome to exercise, the miracle drug. For the miracle to happen,
though, you need to know how to take your medicine, and unfortunately a lot
of people overdose right out of the box, because the dragon they are chasing
is not the one who is the vision of health, but rather the one with rock-hard
abs, massive traps, and spindly legs, who has done more “curls for the girls”
than there are girls on this earth

Exercise can change a lot of that, as long as two things happen: (1) you
actually do it, and (2) you actually do it right.
