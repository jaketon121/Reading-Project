Welcome to exercise, the miracle drug. For the miracle to happen,
though, you need to know how to take your medicine, and unfortunately a lot
of people overdose right out of the box, because the dragon they are chasing
is not the one who is the vision of health, but rather the one with rock-hard
abs, massive traps, and spindly legs, who has done more “curls for the girls”
than there are girls on this earth

Exercise can change a lot of that, as long as two things happen: (1) you
actually do it, and (2) you actually do it right.

# Fuck Exercise Vs Go Training ! 

This is the conventional trajectory for most people in modern society
when it comes to training. It is a trajectory that has been shaped and defined
by conventional wisdom and conventional methods, seeking conventional
results. And all of them have let us down. If we want to own our physical
health, and own the day as a result, we have to abandon our conventional
approach to exercise and think and act unconventionally. In fact, fuck
exercise. Let’s start there. Exercise is for puppies and babies. We need to
train. Train for a healthy body, because healthy is what matters. And training
is what adults do who have goals and a mission to own the rest of their lives.
Training unconventionally is how you do it with a smile on your face.

# Men Like VS Women Like !
Men like good pecs, so they overdevelop their
chest in comparison to their back. Then those big strong pecs start pulling
their shoulders forward, straining their rotator cuffs and front deltoids until
their shoulders blow out. Then by the time they are forty years old, they can’t
even do a pushup anymore, and instead of the chest filling out their shirts, it’s
their gut. Women don’t usually have that issue. Theirs is different. They often
look at an area of their body they don’t like and immediately start trying to
reduce the fat or cellulite there, to the exclusion of most of their body-moving
muscles. Unfortunately, fat loss doesn’t work that way, so they get frustrated
with the results, and working out begins to feel like a waste.
