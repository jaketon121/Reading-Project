# Your Mindset Regarding Yourself
You could have all the other factors down pat yet if your
mind and therefore mindset isn’t right, you’re not going to
get the results that you want in any facet of your life.
Mind is the master, never forget this. Your internal mental
health is something that you may fake to others but it’s
not something that you can fake to yourself.

If you don’t feel great about yourself and your self-esteem
is low this needs to be resolved first before you can go
about getting the most out of life and attracting women
the most effortlessly. Another problem is that our society
engrains it into men’s heads that women are inherently
better than them and of more worth.

# You are good enough VS Women is fuvking beautiful !!!

So one thing you have to get clear right away is that
women are not better than you. There is nothing
inherently noble or special about the female sex compared
to males. The most gorgeous women in the world are not
“above you” and truth be told most are below you. This
process is often called knocking women off of the
pedestal. Meaning where you see women (including
beautiful ones) as just another human being not as these
perfect untouchable goddesses.
As long as the women that you want remain in this lofty
position in your mind, you are not going to have the right
mindset to attract them. Knock them off the pedestal.
Realize that you are already more than enough for any
woman.
You just by virtue of being you are already more than
enough for even the most gorgeous of women. If anythingthey are below you. This may not make sense at first but
it’s an important mental schema to adapt. And as you gain
more experience it will solidify as you’ll quickly find
women aren’t these perfect goddesses that many who are
unsuccessful with women believe.

# value yourself value your time be little selfish .

The best way to value yourself (and do it through actions
which as we all know are much more powerful than
words) is to invest in yourself. Now by invest I don’t
necessarily mean that you go out and buy stocks or spend
money on yourself (though that plays a role). What I
mean is above and before everyone else you put your
time, money, and love into yourself. This might sound alittle “selfish” but in reality it’s what healthy adjusted
men do.
