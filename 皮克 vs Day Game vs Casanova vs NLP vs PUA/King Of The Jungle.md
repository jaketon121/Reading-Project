# Your Mindset Regarding Yourself
You could have all the other factors down pat yet if your
mind and therefore mindset isn’t right, you’re not going to
get the results that you want in any facet of your life.
Mind is the master, never forget this. Your internal mental
health is something that you may fake to others but it’s
not something that you can fake to yourself.

If you don’t feel great about yourself and your self-esteem
is low this needs to be resolved first before you can go
about getting the most out of life and attracting women
the most effortlessly. Another problem is that our society
engrains it into men’s heads that women are inherently
better than them and of more worth.
