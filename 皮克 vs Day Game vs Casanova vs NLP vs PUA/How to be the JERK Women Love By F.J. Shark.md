Did you ever notice the elephant at the circus that was tied with
the tiny 4 foot rope? The reason for this is that when the elephant
was younger and smaller it was tied with a similar rope. He pulled and
pulled on the rope till finally he gave up and never tried again to this
day, when he weighs a few thousand pounds more. The elephant will
never question the strength of the rope again because of what it was
taught to believe.
The old-fashioned core belief of the Social Marketplace is that
the social universe, including all men's individual worlds, faithfully
orbited around the most powerful center of gravity -- Women! This is
comparable to the Geocentric Model of the universe, which stated that
all the planets revolve around the earth. Sadly enough, for hundreds
of years, people believed in this way of thinking to the point of being
punished, tortured, and even killed by their government and religion if
they even questioned its truth. Fortunately, for all of mankind, a few
courageous astronomers did not accept this belief and observed for
themselves, what was really going on and came up with theHeliocentric Model of the universe, which places the sun in the center
with all other planets orbiting around it.

Our parents made the mistake of teaching us good little boys to
grow up and be responsible polite gentleman, treating women with
special velvet gloves and always being sure to putting their wants,
needs and desires ahead of our own in order to keep them happy. I
experienced enough social pain in my life to come to the conclusion
that our parents were about as right as the governments and religions
that supported the idea of the Geocentric Model of the universe.


# The Diamond Player
You are a product in the Social Marketplace, and you have a
choice. Either have your product sit there on the shelf as people go
past and say that they will start that diet tomorrow, next week, next
year or you can be the product that gets purchased.

Women go shopping to satisfy the need of “instant gratification”.
They think: “I see it; I want it; I buy it!” This gives them a sense of
control which is why women shop when they are stressed or to
celebrate a good time with friends. It’s like what people do at the
neighborhood bar. People come in to drink when they are depressed
and people come in to celebrate after their team won the big game.
Anyway, a woman can get the instant gratification from shopping and
is only limited to her cash and limits on her credit cards. This is where
Nice-guys come in. Nice-guys provide women with instant gratification
by doing whatever she says anytime she says it. He becomes the
genie in the lamp. What ever she wants and wishes for the Nice-guy
will answer with: “Your wish is my command.” And then he will carry
this through until she is satisfied with his actions. When a Jerk doesn’t
even flinch when a woman makes her demands, her brain starts to fry.
Women are so used to getting their way with instant gratification thatshe becomes possessed and fixated on what ever is standing in her
way. The Jerks message is: “You can’t have me because you’re
not worthy.” She will want nothing more than to get him and keep
him from that point on. 

I considered myself to be a "Player" in the Social Marketplace,
and it felt like the cards of life had dealt me 4 Aces. The best part was
that it required very little time, effort and energy on my part to
achieve all of this. I thought I was on top of the world. As girls would
sooner please me and want to be with me more than their own
boyfriends. I was obviously creating some sort of attraction and deep
intense feelings in all of these girls that seemed to be lacking with
their current boyfriend relationships. These other boyfriends seem to
be paying the dues, while I was exercising the membership. I really
"had a tiger by the tail" as the saying goes, because I had all this
going on, unfortunately, I did not know what I really did to create it or
keep it going. It would be like Thomas Edison generating light, and
then noticing he forgot to write down the last few steps in the formula
of what he did. –Oops!

Later, I learned that in poker, however rare it may be a Royal
Flush beats 4 Aces any day. From that moment, I wanted to be the
hand that winds across the board like the Trump Card of the Social
Marketplace. Why bother with other combinations, if you can have the
one that takes over in a heartbeat? What I'm talking about is
becoming not just a Player in the Social Marketplace, but a DIAMOND
PLAYER.
The first thing a Diamond Player learns is the definition of. . . .
