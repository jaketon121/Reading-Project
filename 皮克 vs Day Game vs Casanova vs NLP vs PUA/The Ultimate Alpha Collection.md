# Day 1: Habits 

# Habit 1 - Traning - Lifting weights

Lifting weights. Yes, I am an
advocate of lifting weights but not for the reasons most
are. Many people are under the impression that being big
makes you a man. That somehow looking good makes
you a man. This is hilarious. Only women train to look
good and training to look good is a feminine pursuit, train
to be able to fulfill your duty and life as a man. So I don’t
really care if you do the Arnold bodybuilding routine, a
classic 5x5 routine, or even something as inane and dumb
as CrossFit as long as you are getting your ass in gear and
moving. Here is what I personally recommend for
someone who wants to put on some decent muscle and be
conditioned. Barbell complexes. Where they originated I
have no clue and frankly don’t really care, what I do
know is that they are great for putting on muscle while
simultaneously conditioning your cardiovascular system.


# Focus on lifetime habit makes it who you are not shot term invest to X number days and off gone nothing left ...

Now I’m sure you’ve
heard that it takes X number of days or hours for
something to become a habit, and while this may be true
twenty days should not be the end goal. There are things
that are much more important. Do something day in and
day out for a year and maybe it’ll become a part of you.
Don’t focus on getting to X hours or days focus on the
lifetime pursuit, for something to become part of who you
are. So forget certain timeframes we’re looking at a
lifetime, twenty one days simply serves as the start
nothing more and nothing less.
