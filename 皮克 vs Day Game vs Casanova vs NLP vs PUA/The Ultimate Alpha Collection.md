# Day 1: Habits 

# Habit 1 - Traning - Lifting weights

Lifting weights. Yes, I am an
advocate of lifting weights but not for the reasons most
are. Many people are under the impression that being big
makes you a man. That somehow looking good makes
you a man. This is hilarious. Only women train to look
good and training to look good is a feminine pursuit, train
to be able to fulfill your duty and life as a man. So I don’t
really care if you do the Arnold bodybuilding routine, a
classic 5x5 routine, or even something as inane and dumb
as CrossFit as long as you are getting your ass in gear and
moving. Here is what I personally recommend for
someone who wants to put on some decent muscle and be
conditioned. Barbell complexes. Where they originated I
have no clue and frankly don’t really care, what I do
know is that they are great for putting on muscle while
simultaneously conditioning your cardiovascular system.

# Habit 2 - nutrition - 8 glass of water a day 

How
is nutrition a habit you ask? Well like anything else the
more you do something, the easier (generally) it is to do.
Meaning the more you eat healthy and drink water the
easier it is too keep doing that. Here are some quick
recommendations. Drink water, at least eight glasses a
day. At least. If you are not drinking enough. water don’t
worry about any other nutritional advice and start
drinking the eight glasses. Again drink enough water.
Stay away from sugars and processed foods. Get adequate
protein. Eat meat, meat, and more meat. Red meat, eat the
fat (especially if have low testosterone). Sure there are
ways to build muscle and be “healthy” without meat. Just
like instead of traveling to China by plane you could
always go by pogo stick…but one is much easier than the
other. Alright now this may be controversial but for most
people I would say stay away from grains. I know you’re
going to say “but the paleo diet is a fad” and you’re
absolutely right yet nevertheless most people would be
better off cutting out so many carbs from their diet. Carbs
are after all what make you fat not fat. Alright so drink
lots of water, get adequate protein, avoid carbs. 

# Focus on lifetime habit makes it who you are not shot term invest to X number days and off gone nothing left ...

Now I’m sure you’ve
heard that it takes X number of days or hours for
something to become a habit, and while this may be true
twenty days should not be the end goal. There are things
that are much more important. Do something day in and
day out for a year and maybe it’ll become a part of you.
Don’t focus on getting to X hours or days focus on the
lifetime pursuit, for something to become part of who you
are. So forget certain timeframes we’re looking at a
lifetime, twenty one days simply serves as the start
nothing more and nothing less.
