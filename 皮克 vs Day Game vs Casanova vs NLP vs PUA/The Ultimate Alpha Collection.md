# Day 1: Habits 

# Focus on lifetime habit makes it who you are not shot term invest to X number days and off gone nothing left ...

Now I’m sure you’ve
heard that it takes X number of days or hours for
something to become a habit, and while this may be true
twenty days should not be the end goal. There are things
that are much more important. Do something day in and
day out for a year and maybe it’ll become a part of you.
Don’t focus on getting to X hours or days focus on the
lifetime pursuit, for something to become part of who you
are. So forget certain timeframes we’re looking at a
lifetime, twenty one days simply serves as the start
nothing more and nothing less.
