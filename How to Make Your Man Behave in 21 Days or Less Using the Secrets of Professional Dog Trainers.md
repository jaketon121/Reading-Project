# 半碗 - half-bowl 
要让一只狗保持讨好的状态，就每次给他半碗的满足感就好，然后他每一次就会想要更多。
（A known trick for keeping a dog on his best behavior is to just fill his bowl halfway so he's always yearning for more.）

# 

（Same goes for his appetite for affection. Keep him in constant emotional hunger for you and he'll be more attentive and easier to control.）

# 追与放的区别

要是狗跑了，最坏的事情是你追它，它跑的越远。   最好是你自己保持冷静做自己感兴趣的事情，他反而会引发好奇，更想知道你在干嘛。
Miemorize this very important fact about "Flight and Chase Behavior."
If your dog is running away from you, the worst thing you can do is chase after him.
He'll only run faster. Instead, remain calm. Do something interesting to catch his attention. Flaunt a colorful plaything.
Act like youVe having loads of fun without him. Soon he'll be trotting eagerly back.

# 慢入生活

确保你的狗慢慢渗入你的生活，不要一下子进入搅和了一片物品。

Be sure to introduce your dog very slowly into the various aspects of your life, 
or else you could inspire some very neurotic frenzied behavior; i.e., he could get destructive and break something.

# 建立信任而后维持绳索

Until trust is built, keep him on a leash.

故意性的拉长时间直到建立足够的信任。
Progressively lengthen it
as your trust grows.
